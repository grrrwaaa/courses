<p>This graduate seminar is intended as an intensive investigation of current (and historical) theoretical perspectives as they might productively intersect with art practice, at large. The overriding impulse is essentially speculative, geared towards uncovering blindspots within which new forms of praxis can be envisioned. </p>
<!-- Given the appropriation of the avant-garde by the military-industrial-corporate complex—who has long understood and readily exploited the potential for sensory redistribution which to a large extent determines what is thinkable, perceptible—it is urgent for artists not only to gain a firm grasp on the specific modalities by which power operates, but also to develop speculative practices as “positive feedback”, essential to ejecting from increasingly tight communication and control. Consequently, much of this course will be devoted to directly engaging with the idea of the FUTURE, which has suffered greatly in light of the so-called “end of history”.-->
<p>Each week, one or two students will be responsible for leading discussion around assigned readings.  Each student will devote sufficient time to unraveling their various complexities with an eye on developing productive questions to animate group encounters. </p>
<p>A healthy conversation requires rigour as well as open-ness. A willingness to give as much as is taken, suspending the habitual to become immersed in the unfamiliar, and to imagine it further. We don&#39;t get into &quot;the zone&quot; of flow by becoming comfortable, we don&#39;t make discoveries by prescribing what we want. Thus the materials we look at won&#39;t necessarily spring from the art world and its imperatives, even if most come from fields and lines of inquiry of inspirational or influential relation to it. Mapping materials from alien fields into art practice may open up more interesting lines of speculation than theory that already takes for granted the parameters of art. And true to the spirit of adaptation, the readings assigned will develop along with our discussions in a feedback loop. Likewise, any new resonances in praxis or of alternate non-textual nature are also most welcome to the conversation! No matter how deep or far we roam however, the first and last priorities are our own practice. </p>
<p><strong>Grading breakdown</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In-class presentations: 50%</li>
<li>Final Symposium Presentation: 25%</li>
<li>Final Written Document: 25%</li>
</ul>
<p>The final project will consist in a 30-minute presentation, functioning at once as a speculative proposal for a future art project while being grounded in at least two of the assigned readings (and attendant associations which these will inevitably entail). Given that this project does not require (immediate) actualization, speculation can be allowed a wide berth.</p>
<!--These presentations will take place on a day-long Symposium on Art and Speculation (provisional title), which will be open to the public.-->
<p>This presentation will be distilled into a 5000 (PhD) or 3500-word (MA/MFA) written document to be handed in one week after the public presentation. Documents received later than the due date will be penalized three grade points per day that assignment is late. Exceptions to the lateness penalty for valid reasons such as illness, compassionate grounds, etc., may be entertained by the Course Instructor but will require supporting documentation (e.g., a doctor’s letter).</p>

<p>&quot;No matter how alienated we become, we produce patterns that mirror the natural world&quot;--Victoria Vesna</p>
<p>&quot;For the first time the word organic ceases to be an unobtainable ideal held out to the artist; following in the wake of cybernetic technology, systems with organic properties will lead to &quot;sculpture&quot; - if it can be called that - rivaling the attributes of intelligent life [2].&quot; --Jack Burnham, Beyond Modern Sculpture: The Effects of Science and Technology on the Sculpture of This Century (New York: George Braziller, 1968),</p>

<h2 id="life-as-it-could-be">Life as it could be</h2>
<p>The seed for the conversations of CTVA this year is &quot;life as it could be&quot;. Here life is understood both in the sense of the living environment–the world in which we live–as well as the predominantly biological phenomenon of which humans are one example. The phrase &quot;life as it could be&quot; became a mantra for researchers in the field of Artificial Life, a field named in the 80&#39;s but with a longer heritage deeply enmeshed with Cybernetics, and which has likewise today vanished from the public eye to the extent that it has become integral to so many media and fields surrounding us, from deep learning AI to new biomaterials. And for that matter, the current resurgence of virtual reality, frequently forgetful of its visitation two decades ago, so deeply tied into a speculative cyber-culture that is also now ingrained into our theory furniture. A working hypothesis we begin from therefore is a continuum or flat ontology of life and technology as environmental media, the dual sense of media as natural and artificial, elemental and signifying, regardless our preferences. Nature is our oldest and newest inspiration. What is the role of art in a future increasingly saturated in interconnected technology and computational media, at scales far above and below the human? How will established roles adapt or otherwise respond to the world we are creating for ourselves? What new forms, concepts, methods, and critiques emerge? What blindspots or all-too-human limitations can artists reveal? Most of all, how does this reality making itself, within a world unmaking itself, inform your practice?</p>

Living Architectures

The research area of *living architecture* is predicated around the question of whether our lived environment can integrate living or near-living functions. This question has attracted quite significant support. Primarily based in Ontario, the [Living Architecture Systems Group (LASG)](http://livingarchitecturesystems.com), led by architect and artist Philip Beesley, received a 6-year, $2.5m Partnership grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council. York is among its partners, along with many national and international researchers, designers, and artists. In Europe, LASG parter Rachel Armstrong's own Living Architecture research project received [€3.2m of funding](https://www.interaliamag.org/interviews/rachel-armstrong-living-architecture/) from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme. 

As a playful counterfoil to the position papers by these two immense figures, let's also look at a very short but provocative Artforum column by Vilém Flusser. Flusser was a philosopher and journalist shaped by Heideggerian existential phenomenology who later focused on the philosophy of communication and art practice, particularly photography.
