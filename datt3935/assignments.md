## Assignment 1: Canadian Open Data Experience

[CANADIAN OPEN DATA EXPERIENCE](https://www.canadianopendataexperience.ca), Feb 20-22, 2015:

> The Canadian Open Data Experience (CODE) is an intense 48-hour coding sprint where innovators from coast to coast compete to build the best app utilizing federal government data from [Canada's Open Government Portal](http://open.canada.ca). Accelerating Innovation and Hacktivating Open Data: CODE is the first hackathon ever to be funded by the Government of Canada.

As a practice-run for this event, the first assignment will be to find an interesting open data API from open.canada.ca and visualize (and/or sonify) it. You are welcome to use either Max or HTML5 for your work.
