# Assignments

## Assignment 1: Working with APIs

[CANADIAN OPEN DATA EXPERIENCE](https://www.canadianopendataexperience.ca), Feb 20-22, 2015:

> The Canadian Open Data Experience (CODE) is an intense 48-hour coding sprint where innovators from coast to coast compete to build the best app utilizing federal government data from [Canada's Open Government Portal](http://open.canada.ca). Accelerating Innovation and Hacktivating Open Data: CODE is the first hackathon ever to be funded by the Government of Canada.

Anticipating this event, the first assignment will be to find an interesting open data API (possibly, but not necessarily from [open.canada.ca](http://open.canada.ca/en/access-our-application-programming-interface-api)) and visualize (and/or sonify) it. You are welcome to use either Max or HTML5 for your work. The deadline for submission is **before class Feb 4th**. 

## Assignment 2: Interactive (or animated) visualisation

For this assignment we will concentrate on the engaging visual (and sonic?) display of data. The data does not need to be dynamic -- you are welcome to use any kind of input data whether online or offline. [It could be as simple as the digits of Pi](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/03/14/10-stunning-images-show-the-beauty-hidden-in-pi/). The focus this time is in how this data is conveyed or utilized visually (and/or aurally), and how this occurs over time through animation and/or interaction.

Your prototype could be an explanatory presentation, an exploratory tool, or a work of art, but you should make that clear in the documentation so that I can appropriately evaluate it. In an explanatory presentation, design is evaluated in terms of how it conveys the message or illuminates the data. In an exploratory tool, design is evaluated in terms of how it gives more powerful access to data, and enables insight. A work of art will be evaluated according to the terms, motivations and concepts by which you describe it; but these terms must include reference to the data.

You are welcome to use either Max or HTML5 (e.g. D3.js) for your work. The deadline for submission is **end of day March 28th**. 

## Final assignment: Data in context

The final assignment will be a significant application of themes and techniques of the course to a project of contextual relevance, selected from one of the four categories listed below.

Collaboration is permitted, encouraged, but not required. For collaborative projects each student must include a clear statement identifying which parts of the project they were responsible for. 

There will be no final presentation event. Final assignments will be shared online. For those projects implemented in HTML/JS, we can host via the course website, or elsewhere if you prefer. For those implemented in Max, a video documenting the work should be uploaded to a suitable host (such as Vimeo or Youtube). In other respects submission guidelines are the same as previous assignments.

You are welcome to use either Max or HTML5 (e.g. D3.js) for your work.  The final assignment deadline is nominally the last day of classes (**April 20th**), however to provide additional cusioning, I will accept submissions up to the last day of examinations (May 6th). Nevertheless I encourage you to try to submit earlier if you can.

### Option 1: Extend assignment 1 or 2 (or both combined!)

The final project may extend existing work from one (or both) of the assignments or class materials. This is an opportunity to act upon ideas you identified as future directions for the assignments. The project's qualities will be evaluated only according to the new contributions.

### Option 2: Visualizing (or sonifying) cultural data

In this option, cultural media objects are themselves considered a database. These objects could be works of music, paintings, photographs, films, drawings, architecture, software code (limit to software of cultural relevance/impact), poetry, etc. You may wish to focus analysis on one media object, or on a collection. You may also incorporate metadata about the work (such as song lyrics, film subtitles, historical documents, commentaries etc.) so long as the original media object is included. Some kind of computational media analysis will likely be required, such as sonic feature extraction, computer vision, natural language/grammar processing, etc. The resulting data visualization (or sonification) may incorporate the original media, but does not need to. As with assignment 2, your project could be an explanatory presentation, an exploratory tool, or a work of art, or perhaps a combination thereof, but you should make this clear in the documentation so that I can appropriately evaluate it.

For inspiration, you could consider visualizations of cultural data created by artists such as [Lev Manovich](http://manovich.net/index.php/exhibitions), [George Legrady](http://www.georgelegrady.com), [Luke Dubois](http://lukedubois.com), [Aaron Koblin](http://www.aaronkoblin.com/work.html), [Ben Fry](http://benfry.com/distellamap/), [Stefanie Posavec](http://www.stefanieposavec.co.uk/-everything-in-between/#/writing-without-words/), [Fernanda Vi√©gas and Martin Wattenberg](http://hint.fm/projects/listen/), etc. You might also want to read [Lev Manovich's course notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DsAQUQ7paWimVQMNwXDO5Qgm7xnpeqv9HQdpn9EPwsg) on analyzing cultural data.

### Option 3: Augmenting an artwork/project with live data or data visualization/sonification

In this option, you will use knowledge gained through this class to augment a project that you are currently working on, or one which you recently completed. This could be an artwork, or some other project in which you are personally involved. If you choose this option please arrange a meeting with me (online or in person) to discuss the details further.

### Option 4: A data visualization relating to the current labour dispute

For this assignment option, you will author a data visualization relating to one or more of the issues identified in the labour dispute at York. 

A document with infographics regarding the university's offers to CUPE 3903 was posted to [yorku.ca/labour2015](http://labourdisruption.info.yorku.ca/files/2015/03/FactSheet.pdf); and in response CUPE 3903 posted three alternate documents with [charts and infographics](http://3903.cupe.ca/2015/03/18/infographics-we-do-the-math-on-the-employers-latest-offer/). Note that infographics are graphic representations of information or knowledge intended to capture attention and present information with brevity and a clear message; and as such are often a reduction of a visualization of more complex data. However, by doing so they are also at risk of misrepresenting information. The examples from both the University and from CUPE 3903 have weaknesses as data visualizations, which your submission should attempt to overcome. 

Please understand that I will be entirely impartial with regard to the assessment of this option -- you will be graded on the qualities of your data visualization, not on the issues at stake. Similarly, your goal here should be truth to the data. I understand that it may be a sensitive topic, but I also believe that its immediate relevance can be meaningful and motivational.

## Submission guidelines

Submit the project as an archive (zip file), and make sure that this file includes ALL resources necessary for it to run -- all max patchers and subpatchers, any additional extensions required (mac compatible), images, sounds and other media resources, javascript libraries, etc.

Document your work with comments liberally. Try to use helpful variable names, e.g. ```width``` is more communicative than ```var3```.

Add a **README.txt** file including the following items. This file is essential to help me evaluate your work:

- Your **name**
- The **date**
- The **title**
- A **description** of the idea of the system, how it works (or why it doesn't), and why it is interesting, surprising, etc (or why it didn't meet your expectations). What kind of specific and perhaps unusual observations can be made.
- The description must include a **guide** to the interactions it supports (what the mouse does, what key presses do, what links are available, etc.) so that I know how to navigate and operate it. 
- A description of the **technical realization**. (Perhaps you tried a few different algorithms or techniques before settling on the final vision.) 
- **Reference** any other applications/systems/artworks/texts that influenced your design. 
- You can include variations on the project if you found more than one interesting result.
- Ideas for possible **future** extensions of the project.

Your project will be evaluted by these criteria:

- **Technical completeness** (30%).  
- **Aesthetic qualities** (30%). 
- **Novel contributions** (20%). 
- **Effort** (20%).

Plagiarism will be severely penalized.

## Course evaluation criteria

**Note that Course evaluation criteria have been amended as part of labour dispute remediation plan.**

- Assignments 1 & 2: ~~45%~~ 50%
- Final assignment: ~~45%~~ 50%
- Participation: ~~10%~~ 0% 

## Notes regarding remediation

The secretariat issued a [bulletin regarding completion of courses](http://secretariat.info.yorku.ca/files/SenateExecutiveBulletinCompletionofCourses20150316.FINAL_.pdf). Some key points are summarized here, along with the changes and remediation plans specific to this course.

- **Enrolment**. The option to withdraw from the class without grade exist until April 17. Students may also make a formal request for deferred standing.
- **Grading**. There will be no tests in this course, nor a final examination (this had been decided before the labour dispute began). However I have amended the course grading plan to remove the percentage attributed to participation. 
- **Lectures**. Any lectures I give during class time will be simultaneously recorded, uploaded online, and linked to from or embedded within the course web site. We have missed two classes due to strike, and one due to my health. However the length of the term has been reduced by one week, and the calendar has been extended by two, which means that our last class will be April 15th, and no additional classes are required. 
- **Assignments**. 
	- The existing assignment deadline (for assignment 2) has been postponed twice and is now end of day March 28th. 
	- The final assignment deadline is nominally the last day of classes (April 20th), however to provide additional cusioning, I will accept submissions up to the last day of examinations (May 6th). Nevertheless I encourage you to try to submit earlier *if you can*.
	- There will be no final presentation event. Final assignments will be shared online. For those projects implemented in HTML/JS, we can host via the course website, or elsewhere if you prefer. For those implemented in Max, a video documenting the work should be uploaded to a suitable host (such as Vimeo or Youtube).
	- **Reduced assessment.** Unfortunately, by secretariat rules, you do not have the option to request reduced assessment based on assignments 1 & 2 only. Although these do now represent 50% of the grade, they only represented 40% of the original grading components. ["Students may request that their final grade be based on completed, graded assignments that represent 50 per cent or more of the original grading components."](http://secretariat.info.yorku.ca/files/SenateExecutiveBulletinCompletionofCourses20150316.FINAL_.pdf). 
- **Concerns**. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any concerns about the remediation plan. I am happy to discuss alternate remediation plans with any student with special or problematic circumstances. All normal accommodations for persons with disabilities and for religious reasons remain in place and will be respected.
