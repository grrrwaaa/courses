<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> (JS) is a language of growing importance at the intersection of media/culture technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has become the de facto &#39;language of the web&#39;, having evolved from lightweight scripting roots to a full-fledged application language with powerful capabilities in HTML5. </li>
<li>Not only is it used pervasively in client browser-based applications, it is also used for high-performance server applications, particularly using the <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> system. </li>
<li>JS has also been used as an embedded scripting language for desktop applications by Google, Adobe, OpenOffice, Apple, MicroSoft, Qt, GNOME, etc., including many media-oriented applications such as Max/MSP/Jitter, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing.js">Processing</a>, Logic Pro, Unity, DX Studio, Maxwell Render, Flash, etc., and many games/game engines.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: Despite the similarity of name, JavaScript has no particular relation to Java.</strong> JavaScript is however also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript">ECMAScript</a>, JScript, and ActionScript.</p>
<h3 id="for-media-culture-technology-purposes-">For media/culture technology purposes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A browser-based JS application will run on Windows, OSX, Linux, Android, iOS etc., so long as browser applications are up to date. In recent years this has meant that even low-level audio signal processing and 3D OpenGL are available for use. </li>
<li>Browser and server-based applications open up easy possibilities to reach out to vast audiences and connect to social and other media networks, to explore collaborative interfaces, to interact with the increasing number of devices supporting HTTP and WebSocket APIs, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="flexible-fast-well-supported-">Flexible, fast, well-supported:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>JS is a primarily imperative, procedural language (just like C, Java, Python, etc.), however it also supports functional programming features such as first-class functions. It is dynamically-typed and object-based, but uses a more flexible, dynamic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming">prototype-based</a> rather than static class-based inheritance. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Although it is a dynamic language, JS virtual machines such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine">Google&#39;s V8</a>) can achieve remarkably high performance through implicit Just-In-Time compilation to machine code.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>The JS community is vast, and the available libraries, modules, frameworks, extensions, etc. are correspondingly huge. For example <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">npm</a> lists over 100,000 (at time of writing) libraries for node.js desktop/server-side applications. </p>
</li>
<li><p>JS has become the language of choice for several Introduction to Computer Science (CS101) courses, including at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs101/">Stanford University</a> (also <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/cs101">here</a>). The Khan Academy also offers <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/cs">a free, online course</a>.</p>
