# New Media Forms / The Database

[![Flight Patterns, Aaron Koblin](http://users.design.ucla.edu/%7Eakoblin/work/faa/interpolated/us1.jpg)](http://users.design.ucla.edu/%7Eakoblin/work/faa/index.html)

## Course Description

Explores the database as a form in digital media and computational arts. As a navigable repository persistent information, the database intersects memory and network, knowledge and narrative, access and observation. As products of cultural activity, databases present new ways of understanding ourselves at massive scales. We will examine representative and indicative works in art and design, and artifacts of computational culture, to lay the groundwork for future exploration. Students will learn what a database is, how it is constructed, how it is accessed through the web, and how it may be mapped and envisioned for effective dissemination.

## Why?

> Four technology arenas will shape global economic, social, and military developments as well as the world community's actions pertaining to the environment by 2030. Information technology is entering the big data era. Process power and data storage are becoming almost free; networks and the cloud will provide global access and pervasive services; social media and cybersecurity will be large new markets. This growth and diffusion will present significant challenges for governments and societies, which must find ways to capture the benefits of new IT technologies while dealing with the new threats that those technologies present. Fear of the growth of an Orwellian surveillance state may lead citizens particularly in the developed world to pressure their governments to restrict or dismantle big data systems.

## Data in Art, Data Artists

[Figuring Data, Mitchell Whitelaw](http://teemingvoid.blogspot.ca/2013/06/figuring-data-datascape-catalog-essay.html) is an introduction to a gallery show of artists working with data, applying and diverting it for their own ends, as well as offering their own figurations of its potentials and limits. 

> [“Data is the new oil”](http://www.forbes.com/sites/perryrotella/2012/04/02/is-data-the-new-oil/) is a pithy little announcement... [which] constructs data in a certain way; as a sort of amorphous but precious stuff, a resource for exploitation, and a sort of promising abundance... We need not (and should not) accept this analogy; but it demonstrates how data is figured, or constructed, in our culture. Our everyday life and culture is traced, tangled and enabled by digital flows. We produce and consume data as never before. But what exactly is this data? What can it do, and what can we do with it? Who owns or controls it? How can we understand, appreciate, or even sense it?

> Google, Facebook, Twitter and the rest make us - their users - into data... [If we are data, and data can be faithfully preserved, are we now immortal?](http://dialogue.media-culture.org.au/students/jordan-lane)... One of the challenges of data subjectivity is simply knowing oneself: [the scale of our personal data exceeds our grasp](http://christopherbaker.net/projects/mymap/)... In two of the most prominent data art works from the mid 2000s, we mine these personal archives en masse. Golan Levin’s [The Dumpster](http://artport.whitney.org/commissions/thedumpster/dumpster.shtml) and Sep Kamvar and Jonathan Harris’ [We Feel Fine](http://www.number27.org/wefeelfine) scour the internet for “feelings” that are compiled into datasets, and in turn staged as dynamic visualisations... [In] Aaron Koblin’s [Sheep Market](http://www.aaronkoblin.com/work/thesheepmarket/) we can see  both the comical diversity of the crowd (and its sheep avatars), and the uniformity that digital systems encourage. The pathos of this contrast, between the coolness of the digital and the warm, messy intensity of humankind, emerges again in Luke du Bois’ [Hard Data](http://turbulence.org/Works/harddata/), where the tolls of war unfold as stark lists and map references... In many works here [the weather](http://hint.fm/wind/) - a complex (and increasingly uncooperative) material flux - is a sort of proxy for the data-world: a field that is both easy to measure, and difficult to grasp... weather data is a source of aesthetic richness, as well as a pointer to the world beyond, the world that data traces. 

> Rather than some kind of precious (but immaterial) stuff, or fuel for market speculation, data here is a relationship, a link between one part of the world with another, and a trace that can be endlessly reshaped... that connection remains; and art here plays the role that it always has. It transforms our understanding of the world, by representing it anew.
