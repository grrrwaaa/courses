## Course Description

Explores the database as a form in digital media and computational arts. As a navigable repository persistent information, the database intersects memory and network, knowledge and narrative, access and observation. As products of cultural activity, databases present new ways of understanding ourselves at massive scales. We will examine representative and indicative works in art and design, and artifacts of computational culture, to lay the groundwork for future exploration. Students will learn what a database is, how it is constructed, how it is accessed through the web, and how it may be mapped and envisioned for effective dissemination.

## Why?

> Four technology arenas will shape global economic, social, and military developments as well as the world community's actions pertaining to the environment by 2030. Information technology is entering the big data era. Process power and data storage are becoming almost free; networks and the cloud will provide global access and pervasive services; social media and cybersecurity will be large new markets. This growth and diffusion will present significant challenges for governments and societies, which must find ways to capture the benefits of new IT technologies while dealing with the new threats that those technologies present. Fear of the growth of an Orwellian surveillance state may lead citizens particularly in the developed world to pressure their governments to restrict or dismantle big data systems.
