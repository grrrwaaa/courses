<h2 id="assignment-1-working-with-apis">Assignment 1: Working with APIs</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.canadianopendataexperience.ca">CANADIAN OPEN DATA EXPERIENCE</a>, Feb 20-22, 2015:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Canadian Open Data Experience (CODE) is an intense 48-hour coding sprint where innovators from coast to coast compete to build the best app utilizing federal government data from <a href="http://open.canada.ca">Canada&#39;s Open Government Portal</a>. Accelerating Innovation and Hacktivating Open Data: CODE is the first hackathon ever to be funded by the Government of Canada.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anticipating this event, the first assignment will be to find an interesting open data API (possibly, but not necessarily from <a href="http://open.canada.ca/en/access-our-application-programming-interface-api">open.canada.ca</a>) and visualize (and/or sonify) it. You are welcome to use either Max or HTML5 for your work. The deadline for submission is <strong>before class Feb 4th</strong>. </p>
<h2 id="assignment-2-interactive-or-animated-visualisation">Assignment 2: Interactive (or animated) visualisation</h2>
<p>For this assignment we will concentrate on the engaging visual (and sonic?) display of data. The data does not need to be dynamic -- you are welcome to use any kind of input data whether online or offline. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/03/14/10-stunning-images-show-the-beauty-hidden-in-pi/">It could be as simple as the digits of Pi</a>. The focus this time is in how this data is conveyed or utilized visually (and/or aurally), and how this occurs over time through animation and/or interaction.</p>
<p>Your prototype could be an explanatory presentation, an exploratory tool, or a work of art, but you should make that clear in the documentation so that I can appropriately evaluate it. In an explanatory presentation, design is evaluated in terms of how it conveys the message or illuminates the data. In an exploratory tool, design is evaluated in terms of how it gives more powerful access to data, and enables insight. A work of art will be evaluated according to the terms, motivations and concepts by which you describe it; but these terms must include reference to the data.</p>
<p>You are welcome to use either Max or HTML5 (e.g. D3.js) for your work. The deadline for submission is <strong>end of day March 28th</strong>. </p>
<h2 id="submission-guidelines">Submission guidelines</h2>
<p>Submit the project as an archive (zip file), and make sure that this file includes ALL resources necessary for it to run -- all max patchers and subpatchers, any additional extensions required (mac compatible), images, sounds and other media resources, javascript libraries, etc.</p>
<p>Document your work with comments liberally. Try to use helpful variable names, e.g. <code>width</code> is more communicative than <code>var3</code>.</p>
<p>Add a <strong>README.txt</strong> file including the following items. This file is essential to help me evaluate your work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your <strong>name</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>date</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>title</strong></li>
<li>A <strong>description</strong> of the idea of the system, how it works (or why it doesn&#39;t), and why it is interesting, surprising, etc (or why it didn&#39;t meet your expectations). What kind of specific and perhaps unusual observations can be made.</li>
<li>The description must include a <strong>guide</strong> to the interactions it supports (what the mouse does, what key presses do, what links are available, etc.) so that I know how to navigate and operate it. </li>
<li>A description of the <strong>technical realization</strong>. (Perhaps you tried a few different algorithms or techniques before settling on the final vision.) </li>
<li><strong>Reference</strong> any other applications/systems/artworks/texts that influenced your design. </li>
<li>You can include variations on the project if you found more than one interesting result.</li>
<li>Ideas for possible <strong>future</strong> extensions of the project.</li>
<li>Whether you are willing to have your project shared publicly on the course website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your project will be evaluted by these criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical completeness</strong> (30%).  </li>
<li><strong>Aesthetic qualities</strong> (30%). </li>
<li><strong>Novel contributions</strong> (20%). </li>
<li><strong>Effort</strong> (20%).</li>
</ul>
<p>Plagiarism will be severely penalized.</p>
<h2 id="final-project">Final project</h2>
<p>The final project will be a significant project using the themes of this course.</p>
<p>Collaboration is permitted, encouraged, but not required. For collaborative projects each student must include a clear statement identifying which parts of the project they were responsible for. The final project may extend existing work from one (or more) of the assignments, but will be evaluated only according to the new contributions.</p>
<h2 id="course-evaluation-criteria">Course evaluation criteria</h2>
<ul>
<li>Assignments: 45%</li>
<li>Final project: 45%</li>
<li>Participation: 10%</li>
</ul>
