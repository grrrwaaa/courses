	<h2 id="assignment-1-practice-for-the-canadian-open-data-experience">Assignment 1: Practice for the Canadian Open Data Experience</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.canadianopendataexperience.ca">CANADIAN OPEN DATA EXPERIENCE</a>, Feb 20-22, 2015:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Canadian Open Data Experience (CODE) is an intense 48-hour coding sprint where innovators from coast to coast compete to build the best app utilizing federal government data from <a href="http://open.canada.ca">Canada&#39;s Open Government Portal</a>. Accelerating Innovation and Hacktivating Open Data: CODE is the first hackathon ever to be funded by the Government of Canada.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a practice-run for this event, the first assignment will be to find an interesting open data API (possibly, but not necessarily from <a href="http://open.canada.ca/en/access-our-application-programming-interface-api">open.canada.ca</a>) and visualize (and/or sonify) it. You are welcome to use either Max or HTML5 for your work. The deadline for submission is <strong>Feb 1st</strong>. </p>
<p>Submit the project as an archive (zip file), and make sure that this file includes ALL resources necessary for it to run -- all max patchers and subpatchers, any additional extensions required (mac compatible), images, sounds and other media resources, javascript libraries, etc.</p>
<p>Document your work (including Max patchers, JavaScript and HTML files) using comments liberally. Try to use helpful variable names, e.g. <code>width</code> is more communicative than <code>var3</code>.</p>
<p>Add a <strong>README.txt</strong> file including the following items. This file is essential to help me evaluate your work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your <strong>name</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>date</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>title</strong></li>
<li>A <strong>description</strong> of the idea of the system, how it works (or why it doesn&#39;t), and why it is interesting, surprising, etc (or why it didn&#39;t meet your expectations). What kind of specific and perhaps unusual observations can be made.</li>
<li>The description must include a <strong>guide</strong> to the interactions it supports (what the mouse does, what key presses do, what links are available, etc.) so that I know how to navigate and operate it. </li>
<li>A description of the <strong>technical realization</strong>. (Perhaps you tried a few different algorithms or techniques before settling on the final vision.) </li>
<li><strong>Reference</strong> any other applications/systems/artworks/texts that influenced your design. </li>
<li>You can include variations on the project if you found more than one interesting result.</li>
<li>Ideas for possible <strong>future</strong> extensions of the project.</li>
<li>Whether you are willing to have your project shared publicly on the course website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your project will be evaluted by these criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical completeness</strong> (30%).  </li>
<li><strong>Aesthetic qualities</strong> (30%). </li>
<li><strong>Novel contributions</strong> (20%). </li>
<li><strong>Effort</strong> (20%).</li>
</ul>
<p>Plagiarism will be severely penalized.</p>
<h2 id="final-project">Final project</h2>
<p>The final project will be a significant project using the themes of this course.</p>
<p>Collaboration is permitted, encouraged, but not required. For collaborative projects each student must include a clear statement identifying which parts of the project they were responsible for. The final project may extend existing work from one (or more) of the assignments, but will be evaluated only according to the new contributions.</p>
<h2 id="course-evaluation-criteria">Course evaluation criteria</h2>
<ul>
<li>Assignments: 40%</li>
<li>Quiz: 10%</li>
<li>Final project: 40%</li>
<li>Participation: 10%</li>
