Sonnification of a Sonnet


For my final project my main inpiration was from Birdman's title sequence which displayed letters in order of the alphabet to the beat of a drum, which spelt out the opening lines of the movie. One of the optional guidelines of this assignment was to visualize or sonnify some sort of cultural data. I knew I wanted to work with words, so it was a fairly simple choice to use Shakspeare's sonnets as my cultural data. Since sonnets have a pattern within it's pronounciation, I thought of sonnifying this. The easy part was splitting up the sonnet's words into their individual pronounciation based on the "Arabet" code using a dictionary API. The hardest part was finding a meaninful way of sonifying each phoneme to capture a distinct pattern within the sonnet. Unfortunatly I couldn't achieve this, and ultimatley only sonified the individual vowel sounds, while keeping contanants a static sound using a music synthesizer. If I had more knowledge in music theory, or synthesis I may have had a better produced sound.  

The user opens the page, and the sound and text is displayed. Once all phonemes are played within a word it is displayed to the page one by one. The page will automatically scroll to the end of the page, so the user can easily follow the words.

My future ideas for this project would be to split the sonnet line by line using a delimeter, similar to how I split them with each word. By getting each line I can display it line by line, instead of word by word, which will be easier to read, and appear more like a sonnet. I would also like to add an input field for the user to enter a sonnet or poem of their own.
