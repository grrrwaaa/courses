<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>Students attain core literacy in mathematical, systems/process, and computational bases for digital media, including sound, image, and 3D environments, and learn the essential skills of postgraduate-level research in areas of digital media and computational arts. Core literacies include: DSP, sound synthesis, FFT, the graphics pipeline, transformations, lighting, shading, and procedural methods. These core literacies support work across areas including information and systems theory, digital signal processing, 3D geometry, software design, acoustics, simulation and complex systems, networking, human-computer interaction, etc. Core literacies are contextualized by reference to exemplary projects in diverse practices of computational art, music, video games, information visualization, web-based media, responsive architecture, physical computing, etc., including the examination of landmark texts and projects in digital media, computational arts and culture spanning the past century, addressing the continual overlap between artistic and scientific practices. Literacy is evaluated through the ability to understand and transfer published research in these fields into creative applications, recreating established research results, projects, or works of specific interest to the student’s research area(s).</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Quizzes: 20%<ul>
<li>The quizzes that students take are used to test a conceptual understanding of the core mathematical and theoretical concepts of the course, that support work in systems theory, digital signal processing, 3D geometry, software design, acoustics, simulation and complex systems, networking, human-computer interaction, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assignments: 40%<ul>
<li>The assignments that students engage in are used to apply the mathematical and theoretical concepts of the course to experiential outcomes in order to solidify the learning experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Final research paper: 20%<ul>
<li>The final paper allows the student to research one particular topic area (chosen in consultation of the instructor) more thoroughly, creating an 8-12 page paper with scholarly citations on the topic area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Final creative project: 20%<ul>
<li>The final creative project is a test of literacy and the student&#39;s ability to understand and transfer published research in Digital Media into creative applications. It is slightly larger in scope than the smaller assignments.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>The Digital Media graduate program&#39;s academic objectives include promotion of an interdisciplinary approach to computational art-making and technology development, providing students with 21st century “real-world” skills such as creativity, critical thinking and collaboration. To work deeply in the area of computational arts means equipping students to bridge art, science and engineering practices, which requires a foundation in areas of mathematical and computational theory as well as human-computer interaction as they intersect with world of digital art-making. This course creates the context for our students to ensure that they have the conceptual and practical skills necessary for advanced graduate research in the program.</p>

<hr>
<p>This graduate seminar is intended as an intensive investigation of current (and historical) theoretical perspectives as they might productively intersect with art practice, at large. The overriding impulse is essentially speculative, geared towards uncovering blindspots within which new forms of praxis can be envisioned. </p>
<p>Each week, two or three students will be responsible for leading discussion around assigned readings.  Each student will devote sufficient time to unraveling their various complexities with an eye on developing productive questions to animate group encounters. </p>
<p>A healthy conversation requires rigour as well as open-ness. A willingness to give as much as is taken, suspending the habitual to become immersed in the unfamiliar, and to imagine it further. We don&#39;t get into &quot;the zone&quot; of flow by becoming comfortable, we don&#39;t make discoveries by prescribing what we want. Thus the materials we look at won&#39;t necessarily spring from the art world and its imperatives, even if most come from fields and lines of inquiry of inspirational or influential relation to it. Mapping materials from alien fields into art practice may open up more interesting lines of speculation than theory that already takes for granted the parameters of art. And true to the spirit of adaptation, the readings assigned will develop along with our discussions in a feedback loop. Likewise, any new resonances in praxis or of alternate non-textual nature are also most welcome to the conversation! No matter how deep or far we roam however, the first and last priorities are our own practice. </p>
<p><strong>Grading breakdown</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In-class presentations: 50%</li>
<li>Final Symposium Presentation: 25%</li>
<li>Final Written Document: 25%</li>
</ul>
<p>The final project will consist in a 20-minute presentation + discussion, functioning at once as a speculative proposal for a future art project while being grounded in at least two of the assigned readings (and attendant associations which these will inevitably entail). Given that this project does not require (immediate) actualization, speculation can be allowed a wide berth.</p>
<p>This presentation will be distilled into a 5000 (PhD) or 3500-word (MA/MFA) written document to be handed in one week after the public presentation. Documents received later than the due date will be penalized three grade points per day that assignment is late. Exceptions to the lateness penalty for valid reasons such as illness, compassionate grounds, etc., may be entertained by the Course Instructor but will require supporting documentation (e.g., a doctor’s letter).</p>

<h2 id="theme-life-as-it-could-be">Theme: Life as it could be</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;No matter how alienated we become, we produce patterns that mirror the natural world&quot;--Victoria Vesna</p>
<p>&quot;For the first time the word organic ceases to be an unobtainable ideal held out to the artist; following in the wake of cybernetic technology, systems with organic properties will lead to &quot;sculpture&quot; - if it can be called that - rivaling the attributes of intelligent life [2].&quot; --Jack Burnham, Beyond Modern Sculpture: The Effects of Science and Technology on the Sculpture of This Century (New York: George Braziller, 1968),</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The seed for the conversations of CTVA this year is &quot;life as it could be&quot;. Here <em>&quot;life&quot;</em> is understood both in the sense of the living environment–the world in which we live–as well as the predominantly biological phenomenon of which humans are one example. The phrase &quot;life as it could be&quot; became a mantra for researchers in the field of Artificial Life, a field named in the 80&#39;s but with a longer heritage deeply enmeshed with Cybernetics, and which has likewise today vanished from the public eye to the extent that it has become integral to so many media and fields surrounding us, from deep learning AI to new biomaterials. And for that matter, the current resurgence of virtual reality, frequently forgetful of its visitation two decades ago, so deeply tied into a speculative cyber-culture that is also now ingrained into our theory furniture. </p>
<p>A working hypothesis we begin from therefore is a continuum or flat ontology of life and technology as environmental media, the dual sense of media as natural and artificial, elemental and signifying, regardless our preferences. Nature is our oldest and newest inspiration. What is the role of art in a future increasingly saturated in interconnected technology and computational media, at scales far above and below the human? How will established roles adapt or otherwise respond to the world we are creating for ourselves? What new forms, concepts, methods, and critiques emerge? What blindspots or all-too-human limitations can artists reveal? Most of all, how does this reality making itself, within a world unmaking itself, inform your practice?</p>
