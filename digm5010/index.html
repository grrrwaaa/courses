<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>The Digital Media graduate program&#39;s academic objectives include promotion of an interdisciplinary approach to computational art-making and technology development, providing students with 21st century “real-world” skills in tandem with research acumen. To work deeply in the area of computational arts means skillfully bridging art, science and engineering practices. </p>
<p>The first goal of the Foundations course is thus to attain literacy in mathematical, theoretical, and computational bases as they intersect with world of digital art-making, and learn the essential technical and methodological skills of postgraduate-level research in areas of digital media and computational arts. </p>
<p>Technical literacy will be developed in a diversity of tools, programming languages, libraries, and environments, for a spectrum of applications from sound to 3D graphics. The goal is to become equipped to produce compelling new works of research or research-creation at junctures of art and science, aesthetics and engineering. The goal is not to simply acquire skills or competencies in tools, but to develop deep understanding and a real <em>feel</em> for computation as a creative <em>medium</em>.</p>
<p>Literacies will be contextualized by reference to exemplary projects in diverse practices of computational art, music, video games, information visualization, web-based media, responsive architecture, etc., including the examination of landmark texts and projects in the history of digital media, computational arts and culture, addressing the continual overlap between artistic and scientific practices. The goal is to be able to adequately place one&#39;s research within a larger network of relations and lineages, and be able to articulate its relevance and identify its values in context.</p>
<p>Establishing these foundations is ultimately evaluated through the ability to understand and transfer published research in these fields into creative applications, recreating or mutating established research results, projects, or works to the specific interests of a student’s research area(s).</p>
<p><strong>In short, the purpose of Foundations is to equip students to undertake graduate-level research in Digital Media.</strong> This means, being aware of the broad range of the field along with its nearer and farther histories (and implicated futures); being able to find, read, and understand the languages through which research is articulated (in theoretical and practical terms); being able to create work across of a broad range of digital media that is effective and/or innovative.</p>
<h2 id="activities-evaluation">Activities &amp; evaluation</h2>
<p>Every week you will be given readings and be expected to <em>make</em>, and to show what you have made. Some readings &amp; makings will be smaller, some will be more significant. These and other activities in class will account for 60% of the final grade. They are intended:</p>
<ul>
<li>To ensure a conceptual understanding of the core mathematical and theoretical concepts of the course.</li>
<li>To apply the mathematical and theoretical concepts of the course to experiential outcomes in order to solidify the learning experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Toward the end of the course each of you will focus on a specific research paper or project from the literature (chosen in consultation of the instructor). The goal here is to functionally reproduce the work from the literature, and likely mutating it in an interesting way. It implies a more significant project than the weekly meakings, but it could be a continuation of one of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>This project demonstrates your foundational literacy and ability to understand and transfer published research into creative applications. (20%)</li>
<li>You will also document this project an extended paper with scholarly citations on the topic area. (20%)</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also choose to present this project at the end-of-semester graduate event.</p>
<p><a href="http://gradstudies.yorku.ca/current-students/regulations/courses-grading/">The grading scheme for graduate study at York</a> is as follows: 90+ A+ (exceptional), 85+ A (excellent), 80+ A- (high), 75+ B+ (highly satisfactory), 70+ B (satisfactory), 60+ C (conditional), &lt;60 F (fail) or I (incomplete).</p>

<p>This is the first year of the program, the first course of the program. It is thus an experiment that we will carry out together! </p>

<p>What is <em>your</em> research?</p>
<p><img src="img/questions.png" alt="questions"></p>
<p>On the left; the culture, history, context of what we do. On the right, our personal trajectory, our development as researchers and creators. </p>
<p>A futorologist said: to understand the future, we must go much further into the past; to see patterns that recur and trajectories behind the present. However this doesn&#39;t mean entering the future through a rear-view mirror (McLuhan&#39;s warning); it is to understand the language and concepts we see the world in today, and see their gaps and limitations.</p>
<p>We are in a program of <em>digital media</em>, co-run by computational arts and computer science. Art &amp; science. &quot;Two cultures&quot;, meeting through a <a href="cybernetics.html">cybernetic</a> medium of computation. </p>
<p>To discover something new, we cannot follow a single path. Collisions between trajectories derail and open into new possibilities (or sometimes re-open them). Deductive reasoning (logical causation from the general to the particular) can never make a creative association. Insights demand moving from the particular to the general, whether as predicting outcomes (induction) or proposing hypotheses (abduction). </p>
<p>Be comfortable to get out of your comfort zone. Learn from each other. It&#39;s OK to be awkward. Children are the most awkward, and the fastest learners, so <a href="mindstorms.html"><strong>let&#39;s be children</strong></a>. </p>
