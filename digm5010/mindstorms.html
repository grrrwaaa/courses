<p>Seymour Papert was a psychologist and mathematician, and education theorist, deeply inspired by Jean Piaget&#39;s influential research into how children learn. <strong>Mindstorms</strong> is the book that started the computer revolution in schools, pioneering the invention of creative ways to learn through computing. </p>
<p>(It did this through an innovative language called <strong>LOGO</strong> that put children in charge of a drawing turtle. This simple model has had a remarkable impact on a whole generation of thinkers and makers, and also reflects a lineage back to earlier cybernetic &quot;turtles&quot;...)</p>
<ul>
<li>Interested in how learning happens, how understanding <em>grows</em></li>
<li>Inspired as a child by <strong>gears</strong> as a model to understand mathematics &amp; physics (and more). <ul>
<li>Gears serve as a transitional object/metaphor, and use &quot;body knowledge&quot; and putting yourself in their place (&quot;You can <em>be</em> the gear&quot;.) Gears as an <strong>&quot;object-to-think-with&quot;</strong>, using the full range of human sensitivities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;Anything is easy if you can assimilate it to your collection of <strong>models</strong>. If you can&#39;t, it will be painfully difficult... What an individual can learn, and how one learns it, depends on what models one has available.&quot;</li>
<li>(Piaget: children build their own intellectual structures) </li>
<li>The deepest things <strong>we teach ourselves</strong>, and they are accompanied by a <strong>feeling of love</strong> for it (affinity, not talent)<ul>
<li>&quot;Intellectual structures grow out of one another... they acquire both logical and emotional form&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Education, as fostering learning, is about creating the conditions under which intellectual models take root. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;My thesis could be summarized as: What the gears cannot do the computer might. The computer is the Proteus of machines. Its essence is its universality, its power to simulate. Because it can take on a thousand forms and can serve a thousand functions, it can appeal to a thousand tastes. [Mindstorms] is a result of my own attempts... to turn computers into flexible enough instruments that many children can each create for themselves something like what the gears were for me.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Against the &quot;schizophrenic&quot; &#39;two cultures&#39; separation of humanists-artists and scientists-engineers. Suggests computers may be a tool to break this division.</li>
<li>In practice, <strong>knowing-that</strong> (propositional knowledge) and <strong>knowing-how</strong> (procedural knowledge) are very rarely separated.</li>
<li>Computer-aided instruction shoudl not mean making the computer teach--&quot;the computer programming the child&quot;--instead the child must program the computer, attaining mastery and intimate contact with some of the deepest ideas. </li>
<li>Starts with analogy of learning a language, in an active sense: having a conversation with the machine.<ul>
<li>Design an environment in which a conversational approach becomes natural, informal, interesting </li>
<li>Not instructing mathematics, but exploring in &quot;mathland&quot; (not teaching French, but living in France)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>child as builder</strong>: builder needs materials; art of making good materials in the world around the builder</li>
<li>starts with <strong>Turtle</strong> as object-to-think-with. The child &quot;talks&quot; to the turtle by giving instructions, which the turtle interprets from its own perspective, to move around, sometimes drawing lines, or making sounds, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://logo.twentygototen.org">Logo in the browser</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Sympathetic reasoning: To understand how to draw a square, you walk the square yourself, talking &quot;TURTLE TALK&quot; to figure out what to do. It also draws on well-established &quot;body geometry&quot; and other embodied cognition.</li>
<li>Turtles can be on-screen, or physical; they can get quite advanced. Children are learning to program, and learning mathematics, without being taught.</li>
<li>Introduces concept of &quot;<strong>microworlds</strong>&quot;, such as the simple mathland of the Turtle. A place where a certain kind of knowledge can grow with ease, because of the basic materials that are ready-to-hand. <ul>
<li>A rich space of behaviours (e.g. Kaleidoscopes) possible if one turtle can give another turtle instructions.</li>
<li>Another example microworld that can teach Newtonian physics, begins not with forces, but with &quot;dynaturtles&quot; that area always moving, talking when they meet.</li>
<li>Soon students are thinking about what to add to a turtle-nature, what to add to a world-nature.</li>
</ul>
