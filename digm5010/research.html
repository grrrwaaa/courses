<blockquote>
<p>OECD: &quot;Research comprises creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An advancement to current knowledge, produced by systematic work, that is <em>original, valid and significant</em> to a research community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Asking a question that nobody has asked before;</li>
<li>Doing the necessary work to find the answer; and</li>
<li>Communicating the knowledge you have acquired to a larger audience.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="research-is-the-act-of-a-community">Research is the act of a community</h2>
<p>As a member of the research community, you are building on the knowledge that others have acquired before you and providing a road map for those who come after you. You are adding to a body of work that will never be complete.</p>
<p>Research methods vary widely according to the values of different disciplines and communities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic/pure research: pure knowledge, no known applications.</li>
<li>Applied research: more progmatic, empirical.</li>
<li>Research &amp; development (R&amp;D): services/products, typically commercially driven.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scientific research</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Application of the scientific method.</li>
<li>Providing information and theories to explain the nature and properties of the world.</li>
<li>Often involves conducting experiments in the lab or in the field.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research in the humanities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A more relativist epistemology: not searching for an ultimate correct answer, but instead exploring the issues and details that surround it.</li>
<li>Context (social, historical, political, cultural or ethnic) is always important.</li>
<li>Archival work, surveys or in-depth interviews.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research in art?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pablo Picasso said: &quot;I never made a painting as a work of art, it’s all research.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Artistic research, &#39;practice-based research&#39;, can take form when creative works are considered both the research and the object of research itself. Art as research has entered academic institutions relatively recently, and is still somewhat controversial. If art is also research, how is it defined, and how is it evaluated? Why not ask those who fund art research? 
The Society for Artistic Research last year hosted the 9th International Conference on Artistic Research, which was titled ​<a href="http://sarconference2018.org">&quot;Artistic Research Will Eat Itself​&quot;.</a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/funding-financement/index-eng.aspx?tab=0&amp;aID=6&amp;pID=0">Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)</a>, is one of Canada&#39;s three large research funding agencies, and the primary source of arts-based research funding; i.e. who you may likely be applying to funding from in the near future (another may be the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council for research in more scientific aspects of technology). </p>
<p><a href="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/funding-financement/programs-programmes/definitions-eng.aspx#a22">SSHRC describes &quot;research-creation&quot; as</a>: &quot;an approach to research that combines creative and academic research practices, and supports the development of knowledge and innovation through artistic expression, scholarly investigation, and experimentation. The creation process is situated within the research activity and produces critically informed work in a variety of media (art forms). Research-creation cannot be limited to the interpretation or analysis of a creator’s work, conventional works of technological development, or work that focuses on the creation of curricula.&quot; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/funding-financement/apply-demande/background-renseignements/preparing_research_creation_application_idg-preparer_l_application_recherche-creation_sds-eng.aspx">More specifically, grant proposals</a>: &quot;should contain both a developed scholarly apparatus and an integral connection to contemporary literary/artistic practices. A research-creation approach represents sustained, reflective research set directly and actively within the creation process itself. Research exclusively about the creation process or about literary/artistic productions, or creative work involving minimal scholarly investigation, will not be considered to fall within the scope of research-creation. A research-creation proposal must:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;address clear research questions;</li>
<li>&quot;offer theoretical contextualization within the relevant fields of inquiry; and</li>
<li>&quot;present a well-considered methodological approach and creation process.</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Both the research and any resulting creative work must meet peer standards of excellence and be suitable for publication, public performance and/or viewing. The theory and methodology must be aligned with the proposal’s objectives, and the proposal should clearly demonstrate how the research informs the creation process, as well as how the creation process is integrated into and relevant to the project.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://thinkingpractices.wordpress.com/theories-of-art-practices-as-research/">Here&#39;s an annotated bibliography of writing about arts-based research</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-research-question-problem-statement">The research question / problem statement</h2>
<p><strong>Grounded speculation</strong></p>
<p>Personal motivation. It should something you are genuinely interested in. What does your curiosity dwell on? Do you have an original idea or independent perspective to contribute? Something that is difficult yet that you care about enough to make real?</p>
<p>Grounding. Often the problem statement of research is not apparent from the start. A <strong>literature review</strong> can identify flaws or holes in previous research which provides justification for the study. Often the literature review happens before the problem is identified. A gap in the current literature engenders a research question, which may have a parallel hypothesis.</p>
<p>Through a feedback of speculation and grounding the idea can become more concrete and specific.</p>
<h2 id="research-is-speculative-points-to-the-future-">Research is speculative; points to the <em>future</em>...</h2>
<p>The broader motivation is often highly speculative, and often deeply questions or contradicts the status quo. Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does (the world / my culture / my discipline) need (right now / in the future)?<ul>
<li>What are the &quot;ten questions&quot; in your field?</li>
<li>What has been predicted as the impending future -- and what does it need? Or, what is missing from these predictions?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Or, forget the habits of today; what have we missed in the past? We tend to see the future through a <a href="http://lightthroughmcluhan.org/rearviewmirror.html">rear-view mirror</a></li>
<li>Or, place your questions outside the field.<ul>
<li>What is common to all works in a medium, and specific to a medium, yet only rarely articulated? Look for the elephant in the room. What can change our perception of the medium itself? Or, what can be taken away without losing the essence?</li>
<li>What is mountain to climb (not hill)? Go to the edge - there’s not that much there - work back.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What can you identify that differentiates world-changing ideas from common ideas?<ul>
<li>Architecture professor: &quot;Take your brain and throw it into the future as far as you can. Take something said to be impossible and make it. The greater the impossibility, the greater the value of the contribution.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What will art &amp; technology look like in 5, 10, 20 years? What might be a &quot;Black Swan&quot; event that would radically change things? In what should you be conducting your research or research-creation?</p>
<p>For example the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), one of Canada&#39;s three large research funding agencies (and who you may likely be applying to funding from) recently conducted a &quot;horizon scan&quot; to identify future global challenges of emerging technology, whether as opportunities and new directions for societies as well as warnings of potential crises. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/society-societe/community-communite/ifca-iac/ifca-iac-consultation-2018-eng.aspx">Future Challenges Prioritization</a></p>
<p>They then distributed the following survey among researchers summarizing the 16 future challenges they found, to identify priorities in key changes and impacts. Here are the questions they asked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which areas would you prioritize? </li>
<li>For each area that should be prioritized:<ul>
<li>What is a compelling example you have recently seen or heard related this area?</li>
<li>What are the most significant CHANGES that the challenge would cause?</li>
<li>Over the next decade, what IMPACTS would these CHANGES have?</li>
<li>What could happen when two of these IMPACTS interact? Please be as specific as possible, expressed in three or four words.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is there a challenge not listed that you think should be included? If so, what is it? </li>
</ul>
<p>For another perspective, consider the <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/files/2014/03/PIP_Report_Future_of_the_Internet_Predictions_031114.pdf">Pew Report into Digital Life in 2025</a>.</p>
<h2 id="-yet-research-must-also-make-concrete">...yet research must also make concrete</h2>
<p>Work toward a definition of the problem that is <em>clear, concrete, and narrow</em>.</p>
<p>At early stages, diagrams, maps and keywords can be far more useful than prose.</p>
<p><em>Use</em> the literature</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identify clearly the state of the art you are advancing (the field or domain). What are the assumptions in the field you are overthrowing?</p>
<ul>
<li>Or, you may be inventing your own field. Then don&#39;t try to legitimate a new field by making a case; show it by demonstration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The idea should be specific: research goes narrow &amp; deep, not wide &amp; shallow. Keep returning to the original question; the articulation is usually too general, and needs to be sharpened.</p>
<ul>
<li>What will you do &amp; why is it worth doing?</li>
<li>What is the state of the art &amp; where does your work fit?</li>
<li>What is the form of the contribution? (Technical, artistic/compositional/performance, theoretic, ...)?</li>
<li>What are the key decisions &amp; unique differentials?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
