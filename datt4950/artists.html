<p>Design I/O - <a href="http://www.creativeapplications.net/openframeworks/connected-worlds-interactive-ecosystem-for-nysci-by-design-io/">Connected Worlds</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Created by Cambridge (US) based creative studio Design I/O (Theo Watson, Emily Gobeille and Nick Hardeman), Connected Worlds is a large scale immersive, interactive ecosystem developed for the New York Hall of Science. The installation is comprised of six interactive ecosystems spread out across the walls of the Great Hall and connected together by a 3000 sqft interactive floor and a 45ft high waterfall. Visitors can use physical logs to divert water flowing across the floor from the waterfall into the different environments, where children can then use their hands to plant seeds. As the different environments bloom creatures appear based on the health of the environment and the type of plants growing in it. If multiple environments are healthy creatures will migrate between them causing interesting chain reactions of behaviours.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The installation is designed to encourage a systems thinking approach to sustainability where local actions in one environment may have global consequences. Children work with a fixed amount of water in the system and have to work together to manage and distribute the water across the different environments. Clouds return water from the environments to the waterfall which releases water to the floor when it rains.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The animations use digital simulation of a simplified biological model of morphogenesis, with three-dimensional structures generated out of interconnected particles to represent cells.
Each form starts with a initial spherical cluster of cells which is incrementally developed over time by adding iterative layers of complexity to the structure. The aim is to create forms emergently: exploring generic similarities between many different shapes in nature rather than emulating any particular organism, revealing universal archetypal forms that can come from growth-like processes rather than top-down externally engineered design. Cell division is controlled by accumulated nutrient levels. When the level in a cell exceeds a given threshold the cell divides, and various parameters control how both the parent and daughter cells re-connect to their immediate neighbours. New nutrient can be created by photons in cells hit by incident light rays. Nutrient can also be allowed to flow to adjacent cells. The simulation process is repeated over thousands of iterations and millions of particles, with each of the final structures comprising over fifty million cells.</p>

<p>The procedure is fully detailed in <a href="http://www.andylomas.com/extra/andylomas_paper_cellular_forms_aisb50.pdf">his paper &quot;Cellular Forms: an Artistic Exploration of Morphogenesis&quot;</a>. It&#39;s worth reading this paper and considering the similarities and differences with the flocking algorithm, for example.</p>
