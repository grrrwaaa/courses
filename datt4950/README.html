<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> <em>This course addresses computation as a creative medium from a biologically-inspired standpoint to develop artworks, adaptive media and simulations approaching the fascinating complexity of nature.</em> </p>
<p>Artists, composers, designers and architects have always drawn inspiration from nature, but until recently only rarely have they been able to leverage natureâ€™s creative mechanisms. From its origins computing has also found biological inspiration in pattern formation, self-construction and reproduction, intelligence, autonomy and collective behaviour. Frameworks explored in the course include complex dynamical systems, fractals, cellular automata, agent-based systems, evolutionary and developmental programming, artificial chemistries and ecosystems. </p>
<p>The course is focused on practice in the arts, interactive media, and design: interactive audiovisual applications are implemented both in-class and through student projects, and are critically examined by interweaving the history, theory and landmark works in the literature of generative art, evolutionary music and art, and process art, as well as artificial life, systems biology, and bioinformatics research, and philosophies of process, creativity, and the aesthetics of nature. </p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> DATT 2050. No prior study in biology is required.</p>
<p>Open to non-majors.</p>
<p><strong>Learning outcomes / objectives:</strong></p>
<p>At the completion of the course students will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show strong grounding in multiple methodologies of bio-inspired computation, including demonstrating understanding of mathematical, theoretical as well as aesthetic aspects. </li>
<li>Be able to apply methodologies effectively in creative practice to a diversity of digital and interactive media, as evidenced in a project portfolio.</li>
<li>Be able to interpret and reflect critically on a variety of adaptive and generative media.</li>
<li>Leverage experience in the application of cutting-edge creative coding in generative and interactive arts in order to intelligently extrapolate into future culture technologies.</li>
<li>Refine advanced coding skills.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Contact hours</strong> are 4 per week, split between lectures and lab work. Lectures focus on the introduction of theoretical, aesthetic and conceptual content of the course. Labs focus on the application of lecture material in the form of instructor-led reconstructions, excercises/studies, and larger projects, and will include time for one-on-one meetings. </p>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong> is based on assignments, projects, quizzes, readings and participation, with the following weighting for the final grade:</p>
<ul>
<li>30% Assignments: Exercises and readings are assigned throughout the course. Exercises develop essential practice-informed critique and experiential learning.</li>
<li>40% Projects: Projects, realized individually or in groups, demonstrate the effective application of understanding through the course in novel expressions of adaptive media and art. Projects are evaluated in terms of technical completeness, aesthetic qualities and novel contributions.</li>
<li>30% Quizzes, readings and participation. Quizzes are given periodically through the course. Readings are short selections from books or landmark papers, chosen to directly support the assignments and tutorial discussion. Participation incorporates contributions to tutorial discussions, awareness of issues in readings, and the ability to relate tutorial issues to the broader concerns of the course.</li>
</ul>
