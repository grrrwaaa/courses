<h1 id="assignment-i">Assignment I</h1>
<p><strong>Cellular automata</strong></p>
<p>The first assignment is to construct a new cellular system. You can start from <a href="http://codepen.io/collection/nMgEgN/">one of the existing systems</a> we have looked at and modify it, or design and create a new one to explore an idea you have. For this assignment, I prefer that you use the starter-kit from the <a href="lab.html">labs</a>. </p>
<p>Look through the <a href="cellular.html">cellular systems</a> page for ideas of variations to try and implement. You might spend roughly a third of your time choosing what to try and designing, a third actually implementing it, and a third exploring it for interesting parameters, initial conditions, rule variations etc. If you end up with more than one system that is interesting, you can submit them all. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you had an idea that seemed interesting but was difficult to implement or did not lead to interesting results, submit that too (with an explanation of why you think it did not work or did not do what you expected); this is just as important a part of research.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Document your work using comments in the code. Comment all the important operations in the code. Use helpful variable names, e.g. <code>width</code> is more communicative than <code>var3</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ej_SZ_nnZ-FiGrUV1B3ot4jxhEWMX1ii0JQd7bWiEBs/viewform">Submit via this online form.</a></p>
<p>It will ask for:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>title</strong></li>
<li>A <strong>description</strong> of the idea of the system, how it works (or why it doesn&#39;t), and why it is interesting, surprising, etc (or why it didn&#39;t meet your expectations). What kinds of long-term behaviors it supports. </li>
<li>A description of any <strong>interactions</strong> it supports, or interesting variations of global parameters.</li>
<li>A description of the <strong>technical realization</strong>. (Perhaps you tried a few different algorithms until it worked as expected?) If you were inspired by another system, mention it.</li>
<li>Ideas for possible <strong>future extensions</strong> of the project.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Execution: How well instructions were followed and conceptual goals of the assignment were met.</li>
<li>Aesthetic qualities: The clear and consistent articulation and composition of a creative whole, and the experiential and/or conceptual depth thereof, within the frame of the given assignment and context of the course.</li>
<li>Technical completeness: Functionality, accuracy, efficiency, creativity, and clear structure in the development and in the results.</li>
<li>Novel contribution: Ingenuity in response to unanticipated challenges, comprehension and creativity beyond what is demonstrated in labs, and vision in further extension. </li>
