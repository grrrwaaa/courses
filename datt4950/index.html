<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p><em>This course addresses computation as a creative medium from a biologically-inspired standpoint to develop artworks, adaptive media and simulations approaching the fascinating complexity of nature.</em> </p>
<p>Artists, composers, designers and architects have always drawn inspiration from nature, but until recently only rarely have they been able to leverage natureâ€™s creative mechanisms. From its origins computing has also found biological inspiration in pattern formation, self-construction and reproduction, intelligence, autonomy and collective behaviour. Frameworks explored in the course include complex dynamical systems, fractals, cellular automata, agent-based systems, evolutionary and developmental programming, artificial chemistries and ecosystems. </p>
<p>The course is focused on practice in the arts, interactive media, and design: interactive audiovisual applications are implemented both in-class and through student projects, and are critically examined by interweaving the history, theory and landmark works in the literature of generative art, evolutionary music and art, and process art, as well as artificial life, systems biology, and bioinformatics research, and philosophies of process, creativity, and the aesthetics of nature. </p>
