<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>Explores computation as a creative medium from a biologically-inspired standpoint to develop artworks, adaptive media and simulations approaching the fascinating complexity of nature. Artists, composers, designers and architects have always drawn inspiration from nature, but until recently only rarely have they been able to leverage nature’s creative mechanisms. From its origins computing has also found biological inspiration in pattern formation, self-construction and reproduction, intelligence, autonomy and collective behaviour. Frameworks explored in the course include complex dynamical systems, fractals, cellular automata, agent-based systems, evolutionary and developmental programming, artificial chemistries and ecosystems. The course is focused on practice in the arts, interactive media, and design: interactive audiovisual applications are implemented both in-class and through student projects, and are critically examined by interweaving the history, theory and landmark works in the literature of generative art, evolutionary music and art, and process art, as well as artificial life, systems biology, and bioinformatics research, and philosophies of process, creativity, and the aesthetics of nature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Four technology arenas will shape global economic, social, and military developments as well as the world community&#39;s actions pertaining to the environment by 2030. Information technology is entering the big data era. Process power and data storage are becoming almost free; networks and the cloud will provide global access and pervasive services; social media and cybersecurity will be large new markets. This growth and diffusion will present significant challenges for governments and societies, which must find ways to capture the benefits of new IT technologies while dealing with the new threats that those technologies present. Fear of the growth of an Orwellian surveillance state may lead citizens particularly in the developed world to pressure their governments to restrict or dismantle big data systems.<br><a href="http://www.dni.gov/files/documents/GlobalTrends_2030.pdf">Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds a publication of the National Intelligence Council</a></p>

<p><a href="http://teemingvoid.blogspot.ca/2013/06/figuring-data-datascape-catalog-essay.html">Figuring Data, Mitchell Whitelaw</a> is an introduction to a gallery show of artists working with data, applying and diverting it for their own ends, as well as offering their own figurations of its potentials and limits. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/perryrotella/2012/04/02/is-data-the-new-oil/">“Data is the new oil”</a> is a pithy little announcement... [which] constructs data in a certain way; as a sort of amorphous but precious stuff, a resource for exploitation, and a sort of promising abundance... We need not (and should not) accept this analogy; but it demonstrates how data is figured, or constructed, in our culture. Our everyday life and culture is traced, tangled and enabled by digital flows. We produce and consume data as never before. But what exactly is this data? What can it do, and what can we do with it? Who owns or controls it? How can we understand, appreciate, or even sense it?</p>
<p>Google, Facebook, Twitter and the rest make us - their users - into data... <a href="http://dialogue.media-culture.org.au/students/jordan-lane">If we are data, and data can be faithfully preserved, are we now immortal?</a>... One of the challenges of data subjectivity is simply knowing oneself: <a href="http://christopherbaker.net/projects/mymap/">the scale of our personal data exceeds our grasp</a>... In two of the most prominent data art works from the mid 2000s, we mine these personal archives en masse. Golan Levin’s <a href="http://artport.whitney.org/commissions/thedumpster/dumpster.shtml">The Dumpster</a> and Sep Kamvar and Jonathan Harris’ <a href="http://www.number27.org/wefeelfine">We Feel Fine</a> scour the internet for “feelings” that are compiled into datasets, and in turn staged as dynamic visualisations... [In] Aaron Koblin’s <a href="http://www.aaronkoblin.com/work/thesheepmarket/">Sheep Market</a> we can see  both the comical diversity of the crowd (and its sheep avatars), and the uniformity that digital systems encourage. The pathos of this contrast, between the coolness of the digital and the warm, messy intensity of humankind, emerges again in Luke du Bois’ <a href="http://turbulence.org/Works/harddata/">Hard Data</a>, where the tolls of war unfold as stark lists and map references... In many works here <a href="http://hint.fm/wind/">the weather</a> - a complex (and increasingly uncooperative) material flux - is a sort of proxy for the data-world: a field that is both easy to measure, and difficult to grasp... weather data is a source of aesthetic richness, as well as a pointer to the world beyond, the world that data traces. </p>
<p>Rather than some kind of precious (but immaterial) stuff, or fuel for market speculation, data here is a relationship, a link between one part of the world with another, and a trace that can be endlessly reshaped... that connection remains; and art here plays the role that it always has. It transforms our understanding of the world, by representing it anew.</p>
