<p>There have been more than four decades of computational systems inspired by natural evolution. It has become a major field of machine learning and optimization. Beyond AI, it has been used in hardware and circuit design, robotics, and more recently in industrial design and architecture. It has of course also been deeply explored in art and music.</p>
<h2 id="natural-and-artificial-evolution">Natural and artificial evolution</h2>
<p>The theory of natural evolution combines <strong>population, diversity, heredity and selection</strong>. Evolution requires a <strong>population</strong> of individuals that exhibit <strong>diversity</strong> (both similarities and variations between each other, both within and between species). These individuals can produce new individuals; offspring that exhibit similarites with the parent(s) through <strong>heredity</strong>. However not all of the population can successfully reproduce. Any factor that affects the possibility of an individual reproducing, thus also affects what characteristics are inherited in the population as a whole. Charles Darwin&#39;s theory of natural <strong>selection</strong>, proposed in 1859, is that the section of the population that can reproduce is not entirely random, but rather is regulated by interactions between inherited characteristics and environmental constraints (such as available food, populations of symbionts, predators and parasites, and so on). Accordingly, the characteristics of a species may change over time (<strong>evolution</strong>), forming a history that can be investigated through the fossil records.</p>

<p><strong>Artificial evolution</strong> is a form of computational simulation whose process mirrors the abstract structure of natural evolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain a population of finite individuals (which can reproduce)</li>
<li>Support variation (including new characteristics) in the population</li>
<li>Provide a mechanism of heredity between generations</li>
<li>Provide a mechanism of selection </li>
</ul>
<p>The main systematic differences are that the underlying mechanisms specified by us in advance, as are the initial populations and environmental conditions (if any). Most importantly, <em>the mechanism of selection is usually predetermined</em>. </p>
<h3 id="common-misconceptions">Common misconceptions</h3>
<p>Darwin&#39;s theory is sometimes misrepresented as &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; or even the competitive &quot;law of the jungle&quot;. We have already seen that the notion of &quot;fittest&quot; is misguided, since it implies a static absolute measure for something that is both dynamic and highly contextual. </p>
<p>Most artificial systems are used toward a particular goal (<em>teleological</em>, even in artistic pursuits), in which there is a valid sense that one candidate genome may be fitter than another. But in natural evolution there is no pre-defined (<em>a priori</em>) fitness measure, since the environmental conditions (and selective criteria) evolve along with each species -- evolution is thus adaptive in an open-ended, undirected, goal-less (<em>non-teleological</em>), and <em>natural evolution does not imply progress</em>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since there is no absolute goal or progress, the most we can measure in natural evolution is the changing frequencies over time of individual species, or of individual characteristics of a population.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor is competition the prime mode of interaction between species; most species are relatively independent, and the ones that do closely interact are more likely to be collaborative (symbiotic, parasitic, etc.) than competitive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Evolution does not imply that individuals display selfish, competitive behavior. When Dawkins described evolution in terms of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene">selfish genes</a>, it indicates a gene-centric perspective on evolution that implies selfless and sometimes altruistic behavior in organisms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, an individual or species does not need to be the fittest, merely fit enough to survive long enough to reproduce, i.e. to be <em>viable</em>. The survival of a natural species depends on its <em>viability</em>; the ability of enough individuals to live long enough to reproduce within an unpredictable environment. </p>
<h3 id="viability-and-ecosystemic-evolution">Viability and ecosystemic evolution</h3>
<p>By pre-defining the selection mechanisms, most artificial evolutionary systems impose a static <em>fitness</em> measure that is extremely unnatural, gearing evolution toward a desired, fixed metric (some critics compare it more to <em>selective breeding</em>). Such artificial evolution will not match the creative diversity of natural evolution.Nevertheless, an artificial, viability-oriented form of evolution may be used for more theoretical and aesthetic branches of artificial life research. In these cases the viability measure arises as an emergent property of underlying laws of the world, such as the requirement to maintain energetic/metabolic balance or to maintain structural integrity, as well as the collective effects of multiple species and non-living dynamics within the environment. For this reason a viability-oriented approach is sometimes referred to as <em>ecosystemic selection</em>. <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-78761-7_42">See discussion here</a></p>
