<p><strong>Artificial life</strong> (often abbreviated ALife or A-Life) is a field of study and an associated art form which examine systems related to life, its processes, and its evolution, through the use of simulations with computer models, robotics, and biochemistry. Artificial life was named by Christopher Langton in 1986, but it can trace examples from the dawn of computing. The earliest computer scientists and cyberneticians (Turing, von Neumann, Wiener, Ashby) investigated artificial approaches to biological phenomena. In a sense, it also reformulates an age-old motivation to create life from artifice, such as the Golem, early automatons, and <em>anima</em>tion. </p>
<p>A major hypothesis is that <strong>life is not a property of the specific matter we know, but rather a more general property of particular organizations and behaviors</strong>. Computing pioneer John von Neumann claimed that &quot;life is a process which can be abstracted away from any particular medium&quot;. If so, there is no reason to suppose that life cannot occur in systems that are not part of our natural evolution, including digital media. Artificial life can be broadly categorized according to the media used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soft: digital simulation</li>
<li>Hard: physical robotic</li>
<li>Wet: biochemical manipuation</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast to more traditional science, which focuses on particular systems to capture their principal parameters, the core strategy in Artificial Life is to investigate the principles of life through simulation. This involves finding simple rules that can generate complex behaviors, in a <strong>bottom-up</strong> approach. (At the birth of Artificial Life this was a sharp departure from top-down symbolic AI, but today this is no longer a reliable distinction.) </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bio-inspired computing</strong> is the use of computers to model the living phenomena, and simultaneously the study of life to improve the usage of computers... It takes a decentralised approach: bio-inspired techniques often involve the method of specifying a set of simple rules, a set of simple organisms which adhere to those rules, and a method of iteratively applying those rules. After several generations of rule application it is usually the case that some forms of complex behaviour arise.  <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio-inspired_computing">wikipedia</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to this methodology, Artificial life research can also be categorized according to principal motivations and modes of evaluation (<a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/002409402760105271">Exteberria, &quot;Artificial Evolution and Lifelike Creativity&quot;</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scientific models</strong>: as analytical tools to propose and evaluate theories with respect to actual life phenomena,</li>
<li><strong>Engineering/design tools</strong>: a problem solving-strategy evaluated according to fit, efficiency, accuracy etc.,</li>
<li><strong>New ontologies and instantiations</strong>: evaluated for other criteria involving &#39;lifelikeness&#39;; including generative arts (<strong>&quot;life as it could be&quot;</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been significant for philosophy: &quot;Artificial life’s computational methodology is a direct and natural extension of philosophy’s traditional methodology of a priori thought experiment.&quot; <a href="http://authors.library.caltech.edu/13564/1/BEDal00.pdf">Bedau, M. Open Problems in Artifical Life</a></p>
<p>From the earliest papers in the Artificial Life conference proceedings and journals, examples of all three perspectives are present, along with acknowledgement of the difficult philosophical questions, and example projects demonstrating remarkable capacity for adaptation and emergent complexity despite their inherent simplicity.</p>

<h2 id="controversy">Controversy</h2>
<p>Artificial Life is not without controversy. Although it aims to dispel earlier <em>vitalism</em>, it remains deeply enmeshed in the controversies regarding <em>emergence</em> and <em>complexity</em> (see &quot;from complexity to perplexity&quot; (Horgan)), with similar challenges as AI and the study of consciousness. As a science it has been accused of being &quot;fact-free&quot; (Maynard Smith), yet its research has been published in <em>Science</em> and <em>Nature</em>. </p>
<p>The question of artificial nature touches the nerve of creativity; an enticing opportunity for generative and algorithmic arts. Art/culture critic Edward Shanken suggests that ALife is grounded in theory and ideas more than in life itself. Simon Penny, N. Katharine Hayles and Rodney Brooks criticized both AI and ALife for being &#39;disembodied&#39;, priveling mind over body; though more contemporary ALife now involves greater interaction, immersion, robotics and biochemistry. </p>
<p>The position of life as property of organization has been characterized as <strong>strong ALife</strong>. The <strong>weak ALife</strong> position on the other hand allows that we can simulate life in order to understand the mechanisms of real living entities, but we cannot actually synthesize life itself. In any case, to define a simulation as &#39;alive&#39; depends on having a widely agreed upon definition of &#39;life&#39; itself, which remains problematic. </p>
<p>Soft ALife has also been frequently related to issues of computer security and viruses, and hard/wet ALife with cyborg and biological disaster, and warfare.</p>
<p>We have found that life isn&#39;t always what we think it is: evolution is not necessarily progressive, nor gradual, survival is not often a question of fitness, large amounts of DNA are shared between incredibly different species, environmental nurture is essential to development, etc. Can we understand more deeply by creating autonomous life-like systems?</p>
<p>Life is the best example we have of systems adapting to unpredictable environments while propagating complexity; of surpassing themselves. What we learn may inform adaptive, responsive (responsible? sustainable?) designs for present-day concerns: biotech, ubicomp, cloud &amp; device, robotics... </p>
<p>It may offer opportunities to raise new ethical issues. For example, the post-human / post-organic life discussions (see Hayles); away from &#39;essentialism&#39; toward &#39;cyborg subjects&#39; (Haraway). The future of <em>our</em> life is (and always has been) deeply connected with the future of machines.</p>
