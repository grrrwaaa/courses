# Mindstorms (1980)

Seymour Papert was a psychologist and mathematician, and education theorist, deeply inspired by Jean Piaget's influential research into how children learn. **Mindstorms** is the book that started the computer revolution in schools, pioneering the invention of creative ways to learn through computing. 

(It did this through an innovative language called **LOGO** that put children in charge of a drawing turtle. This simple model has had a remarkable impact on a whole generation of thinkers and makers, and also reflects a lineage back to earlier cybernetic "turtles"...)

- Interested in how learning happens, how understanding *grows*
- Inspired as a child by **gears** as a model to understand mathematics & physics (and more). 
	- Gears serve as a transitional object/metaphor, and use "body knowledge" and putting yourself in their place ("You can *be* the gear".) Gears as an **"object-to-think-with"**, using the full range of human sensitivities.
- "Anything is easy if you can assimilate it to your collection of **models**. If you can't, it will be painfully difficult... What an individual can learn, and how one learns it, depends on what models one has available."
- (Piaget: children build their own intellectual structures) 
- The deepest things **we teach ourselves**, and they are accompanied by a **feeling of love** for it (affinity, not talent)
	- "Intellectual structures grow out of one another... they acquire both logical and emotional form"
- Education, as fostering learning, is about creating the conditions under which intellectual models take root. 

> "My thesis could be summarized as: What the gears cannot do the computer might. The computer is the Proteus of machines. Its essence is its universality, its power to simulate. Because it can take on a thousand forms and can serve a thousand functions, it can appeal to a thousand tastes. [Mindstorms] is a result of my own attempts... to turn computers into flexible enough instruments that many children can each create for themselves something like what the gears were for me."

- Against the "schizophrenic" 'two cultures' separation of humanists-artists and scientists-engineers. Suggests computers may be a tool to break this division.
- In practice, **knowing-that** (propositional knowledge) and **knowing-how** (procedural knowledge) are very rarely separated.
- Computer-aided instruction shoudl not mean making the computer teach--"the computer programming the child"--instead the child must program the computer, attaining mastery and intimate contact with some of the deepest ideas. 
- Starts with analogy of learning a language, in an active sense: having a conversation with the machine.
	- Design an environment in which a conversational approach becomes natural, informal, interesting 
	- Not instructing mathematics, but exploring in "mathland" (not teaching French, but living in France)
- **child as builder**: builder needs materials; art of making good materials in the world around the builder
- starts with **Turtle** as object-to-think-with. The child "talks" to the turtle by giving instructions, which the turtle interprets from its own perspective, to move around, sometimes drawing lines, or making sounds, etc.

- Sympathetic reasoning: To understand how to draw a square, you walk the square yourself, talking "TURTLE TALK" to figure out what to do. It also draws on well-established "body geometry" and other embodied cognition.
- Turtles can be on-screen, or physical; they can get quite advanced. Children are learning to program, and learning mathematics, without being taught.
- Introduces concept of "**microworlds**", such as the simple mathland of the Turtle. A place where a certain kind of knowledge can grow with ease, because of the basic materials that are ready-to-hand. 
	- A rich space of behaviours (e.g. Kaleidoscopes) possible if one turtle can give another turtle instructions.
	- Another example microworld that can teach Newtonian physics, begins not with forces, but with "dynaturtles" that area always moving, talking when they meet.
	- Soon students are thinking about what to add to a turtle-nature, what to add to a world-nature.
