## Course Description

The Digital Media graduate program's academic objectives include promotion of an interdisciplinary approach to computational art-making and technology development, providing students with 21st century “real-world” skills in tandem with research acumen. To work deeply in the area of computational arts means skillfully bridging art, science and engineering practices. 

The first goal of the Foundations course is thus to attain literacy in mathematical, theoretical, and computational bases as they intersect with world of digital art-making, and learn the essential technical and methodological skills of postgraduate-level research in areas of digital media and computational arts. 

Technical literacy will be developed in a diversity of tools, programming languages, libraries, and environments, for a spectrum of applications from sound to 3D graphics. The goal is to become equipped to produce compelling new works of research or research-creation at junctures of art and science, aesthetics and engineering. The goal is not to simply acquire skills or competencies in tools, but to develop deep understanding and a real *feel* for computation as a creative *medium*.

Literacies will be contextualized by reference to exemplary projects in diverse practices of computational art, music, video games, information visualization, web-based media, responsive architecture, etc., including the examination of landmark texts and projects in the history of digital media, computational arts and culture, addressing the continual overlap between artistic and scientific practices. The goal is to be able to adequately place one's research within a larger network of relations and lineages, and be able to articulate its relevance and identify its values in context.

Establishing these foundations is ultimately evaluated through the ability to understand and transfer published research in these fields into creative applications, recreating or mutating established research results, projects, or works to the specific interests of a student’s research area(s).

**In short, the purpose of Foundations is to equip students to undertake graduate-level research in Digital Media.** This means, being aware of the broad range of the field along with its nearer and farther histories (and implicated futures); being able to find, read, and understand the languages through which research is articulated (in theoretical and practical terms); being able to create work across of a broad range of digital media that is effective and/or innovative.

## Activities & evaluation

Every week you will be given readings and be expected to *make*, and to show what you have made. Some readings & makings will be smaller, some will be more significant. These and other activities in class will account for 60% of the final grade. They are intended:
- To ensure a conceptual understanding of the core mathematical and theoretical concepts of the course.
- To apply the mathematical and theoretical concepts of the course to experiential outcomes in order to solidify the learning experience.

Toward the end of the course each of you will focus on a specific research paper or project from the literature (chosen in consultation of the instructor). The goal here is to functionally reproduce the work from the literature, and likely mutating it in an interesting way. It implies a more significant project than the weekly meakings, but it could be a continuation of one of them.
- This project demonstrates your foundational literacy and ability to understand and transfer published research into creative applications. (20%)
- You will also document this project an extended paper with scholarly citations on the topic area. (20%)

You may also choose to present this project at the end-of-semester graduate event.

[The grading scheme for graduate study at York](http://gradstudies.yorku.ca/current-students/regulations/courses-grading/) is as follows: 90+ A+ (exceptional), 85+ A (excellent), 80+ A- (high), 75+ B+ (highly satisfactory), 70+ B (satisfactory), 60+ C (conditional), <60 F (fail) or I (incomplete).

## Year Zero

> "People seldom get anything right on the first try... the constant need of course-corrections...is the essence of creative activity". *Seymour Papert, Mindstorms 2nd ed, 1993.*

This is the first year of the program, the first course of the program. It is thus an experiment that we will carry out together! 

### Wonder, wander, make

What is *your* research?

On the on hand; the culture, history, context of what we do. On the other, our personal trajectory, our development as researchers and creators. 

A futorologist said: to understand the future, we must go much further into the past; to see patterns that recur and trajectories behind the present. However this doesn't mean entering the future through a rear-view mirror (McLuhan's warning); it is to understand the language and concepts we see the world in today, and see their gaps and limitations.

We are in a program of *digital media*, co-run by computational arts and computer science. Art & science. "Two cultures", meeting through a [cybernetic](cybernetics.html) medium of computation. 

To discover something new, we cannot follow a single path. Collisions between trajectories derail and open into new possibilities (or sometimes re-open them). Deductive reasoning (logical causation from the general to the particular) can never make a creative association. Insights demand moving from the particular to the general, whether as predicting outcomes (induction) or proposing hypotheses (abduction). 

Be comfortable to get out of your comfort zone. Learn from each other. It's OK to be awkward. Children are the most awkward, and the fastest learners, so [**let's be children**](mindstorms.html).

Creating mobile agents. 

![Fish school](http://underthecblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/fishschool.gif)

Some of the most beautiful, fascinating or strange phenomena of nature can be understood as emerging from the behaviors of interacting agents. Widely acknowledged examples include the murmuration of birds (or swarming insects, schools of fish), and the societal 'superorganisms' of ant colonies. We have come to understand that despite the obvious organization that we see at the macro-scale, there is no hierarchical center of coordination, but rather the whole emerges from simple interactions at local levels. These have been suggested as examples of emergence, or of self-organization. Which is to say, the whole is greater than a naive sum of its parts. 

Agent-based models, or multi-agent systems, attempt to understand how non-trivial organized macro-behavior emerges from typically mobile individuals that interact primarily at a local-level. These individuals are called **agents**. Besides modeling flocks and colonies, agent-based modeling has applications from microbiology to sociology, as well as video games and computer graphics. As a biological approximation, an agent could refer to anything from an individual protein, virus, cell, bacterium, organism, or deme (a population group). Agent systems also share many features with particle systems, and the two are sometimes conflated.

The definition of an agent can vary widely, but in most cases, **an autonomous agent interacts within an environment populated by other agents, but behaves independently without taking direct commands from other agents nor a global planner or leader.** Agent-based models consist of **populations** that typically operate in parallel, typically within a spatial world, often mobile. At times, the self-organizing behavior of systems of even relatively simple agents can be unpredictable, complex, and generate new emergent structures of order. 

In addition to whatever the environment provides, agents may have:

- **Properties**: Persistent but variable features of an agent, such as size, color, speed, direction, energy level, and so on. 
- **Input**: Limited capabilities of sensing (or receiving messages from) the environment
- **Output**: Limited capabilities of performing actions on (or sending messages to) the environment, or its own properties, such as orientation and speed.
- **Processing**: An information processing capacity to select actions in response to inputs. This capacity may also include information storage (memory).

#### Tortoises and Vehicles

![Machina Speculatrix](http://www.rutherfordjournal.org/images/020101-05.jpg) 

In the late 1940's and early 1950's, Cyberneticist Grey Walter pioneered the engineering of autonomous agents, as early examples of self-directed robots, with his series of *"tortoises"*. 

<iframe width="720" height="540" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLULRlmXkKo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Remarkably, this direction of research was largely forgotten as efforts in artificial intelligence concentrated on symbolic thinking. A brief history [can be read here](http://www.rutherfordjournal.org/article020101.html) -- but the story of Walter and other British Cyberneticians is truly fascinating; I highly recommend Andrew Pickering's account in [The Cybernetic Brain](http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo8169881.html). Walter's tortoises have inspired many great research products of the last century, including the turtle graphics of Logo, the situated robotics of Rodney Brooks, the flocking behaviors of Craig Reynolds, and Valentino Braitenberg's Vehicles.

#### Boids & steering behaviours:

[Craig W. Reynolds. Steering Behaviors For Autonomous Characters. In Game developers conference (Vol. 1999, pp. 763-782).](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/gdc99/)

Craig Reynolds' work with robotics is strongly inspired by Braitenberg's and Walter's vehicles. In the late 1980s Reynolds proposed a model of animal motion that has been very influential in robotics, game design, special effects and simulation. It breaks agent movement in general into three layers:

- **Action Selection**: selecting actions to perform according to environmental input and goals to achieve. 
- **Steering**: path determination according to the action selected. Many different behaviors can be used; the essential strategy is ```steering force = desired_velocity - current_velocity```.
- **Locomotion**: mechanisms of conversion of steering into actual movement.

His paper concentrates on the steering layer, presenting a catalogue of behaviours. One of the most celebrated outcomes is a model to model flocks, herds and schools, which he named *boids*. Reynolds' paper covers boids as an aggregate of other steering behaviours (cohesion, avoidance, alignment). 

Crucially, the steering behavior of a boid depends on properties of other agents that it can perceive (its *neighborhood*). The simplest way to detect nearby agents is to simply iterate all agents and test to see if they are near. This isn't especially efficient, but for small populations it is quite reasonable. Apart from a local distance condition, we might also want to have a local angle condition -- e.g. agents that can only see things in front of them. Thus we need an agent-centric (egocentric, rather than exocentric) way of thinking and working (remember Mindstorms...). 

To simulate agent's *point of view* , it helps to think of coordinate frames centred on the agent. Coordinate frames can be represented by matrices in linear algebra; for this  let's use [glMatrix](http://glmatrix.net). There is a quick intro/cheatsheet on this on our [Javascript](javascript.html) page.

### Week 5: Oct 9

- Continuing with agents and boids
	- Agents using ES6 classes
	- Separate update & draw
	- Separate agent "update" and "move"
	- For "move":
		- If mass==1, force==acceleration
		- add acceleration to velocity, zero acceleration after
		- get orientation from velocity (Math.atan2)
		- simplest friction by scaling velocity
		- boundary: wrap, clamp, reset?
	- Agent "update" combines multiple influences into the vec2 "force" (each influence may need a scaling factor)
		- random wander
			- velocity as seeking a point roughly ahead of agent (distance implies speed)
			- Reynold's seek: force = desired - current velocity
		- separation
			- consider all agents below critical distance
			- scale relative position by inverse square distance, as force
		- attraction
			- consider all agents below attraction range
			- get average relative position as force
		- alignment 
			- consider all agents in visible field
			- get average velocity minus own velocity as force
	- Extensions: 
		- let agents communicate (e.g. colour infections)
		- add more kinds of forces!
		- have different agent types in same space
		- let space have static obstacles
		- vary size (including mass?)
		- vary sensitivities? evolve them
		- sharks & fish?
