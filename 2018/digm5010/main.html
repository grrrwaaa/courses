<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>The Digital Media graduate program&#39;s academic objectives include promotion of an interdisciplinary approach to computational art-making and technology development, providing students with 21st century “real-world” skills in tandem with research acumen. To work deeply in the area of computational arts means skillfully bridging art, science and engineering practices. </p>
<p>The first goal of the Foundations course is thus to attain literacy in mathematical, theoretical, and computational bases as they intersect with world of digital art-making, and learn the essential technical and methodological skills of postgraduate-level research in areas of digital media and computational arts. </p>
<p>Technical literacy will be developed in a diversity of tools, programming languages, libraries, and environments, for a spectrum of applications from sound to 3D graphics. The goal is to become equipped to produce compelling new works of research or research-creation at junctures of art and science, aesthetics and engineering.</p>
<p>Literacies will be contextualized by reference to exemplary projects in diverse practices of computational art, music, video games, information visualization, web-based media, responsive architecture, physical computing, etc., including the examination of landmark texts and projects in digital media, computational arts and culture spanning the past century, addressing the continual overlap between artistic and scientific practices. The goal is to be able to adequately place one&#39;s research within a larger network of relations and lineages, and be able to articulate its relevance and identify its values in context.</p>
<p>Establishing these foundations is ultimately evaluated through the ability to understand and transfer published research in these fields into creative applications, recreating or mutating established research results, projects, or works to the specific interests of a student’s research area(s).</p>
<p><strong>In short, the purpose of Foundations is to equip students to undertake graduate-level research in Digital Media.</strong> This means, being aware of the broad range of the field along with its nearer and farther histories (and implicated futures); being able to find, read, and understand the languages through which research is articulated (in theoretical and practical terms); being able to create work across of a broad range of digital media that is effective and/or innovative.</p>
