<h2 id="a-good-modern-web-browser">A good modern web browser</h2>
<p>Of all the browser options, Chrome and Firefox are usually at the forefront of developing web technology, such as having support for things like audio signal processing, 3D graphics, VR. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Here&#39;s Firefox</a>; made by the not-for-profit Mozilla Foundation. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.ca/chrome">Here&#39;s Chrome</a>, and here&#39;s the near-identical open-source alternative, <a href="https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium">Chromium</a>, both made by Google.</p>
<p>Learn how to open the browser&#39;s developer tools console, where JavaScript errors will be posted, where new javascript statements can be immediately written and evaluated, where the HTML DOM can be inspected, etc.</p>
<h2 id="codepen-jsfiddle-etc-">Codepen / jsFiddle / etc.</h2>
<p>Like having a development environment in the cloud, these websites allow you to quickly code up HTML/CSS/Javascript browser code and see the results immediately. </p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/">Here&#39;s codepen</a> -- Sign up (for free) to be able to save and share sketches.</p>
<h2 id="visual-studio-code">Visual Studio Code</h2>
<p>A not-so-heavy code editor with many integrated features (including a command line terminal). (Not to be confused with Visual Studio, which is a behemoth enviornment primarily oriented to C++ and C# development on Windows.)</p>
<p>Why VSCode? </p>
<ul>
<li>It behaves nearly identically on Windows, OSX, Linux, etc.</li>
<li>At present it is the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#development-environments-and-tools">most loved development environment</a>.</li>
<li>Super configurable: Lots of plugins, you can set up build tasks, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Download here</a>. Among the install options, if it asks to add features to the Finder/Explorer window, I recommend enabling them. Similarly if it asks to add <code>code</code> to the PATH, I recommend this too.</p>
<h2 id="node-js-and-npm">Node.js and NPM</h2>
<p>Node.js is an event-driven environment oriented toward command-line apps and servers, written in JavaScript. With Node.js we can easily write servers to generate static and dynamic web-pages, which also talk to other services in the operating system, like reading &amp; writing files, databases, sensor networks, etc. NPM is Node&#39;s <code>package manager</code>, a way to easily define and install additional library dependencies to extend the capabilities of Node, and to automate build processes of your own projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node.js installers can be downloaded here</a> -- I recommend the LTS (Long Term Service) version. Installing Node with default options will also install NPM. Be sure to select the option to add Node and NPM to your PATH (so that you can use them from the command line).</p>

<h2 id="git-and-github">Git and Github</h2>
<p>Git is a &quot;version control&quot; system (VCS); essentially a way to keep a history of edits made to a code-base (AKA repositories). It&#39;s not the only VCS -- there&#39;s also svn, hg, etc. But git is the most widely-used. </p>
<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/download">Download &amp; run the Git command line tools installer from here</a>. </p>
<p>Github is an online cloud for storing and sharing code repositories. It&#39;s also not the only one, there&#39;s Bitbucket, Gitlab, Sourceforge etc. However Github has historically had the largest number of open-source repositories on it, and has a particularly nice feature that it also supports static web hosting (simply by creating a <code>branch</code> in your repository with the name <code>gh-pages</code>), which will be useful for us.</p>
