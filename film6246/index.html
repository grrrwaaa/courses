<p><strong>Course:</strong> FILM 6246<br><strong>Class/lab time:</strong> Thursdays 10:00am - 2:00pm<br><strong>Location:</strong> 309 GCFA (<em>not 303 as listed in the YorkU system!</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Course director:</strong> Graham Wakefield<br><strong>Office:</strong> 303C GCFA<br><strong>Email:</strong> grrrwaaa at yorku dot ca    </p>
<p>This hands-on course gives you an opportunity to learn about new screen technologies, approaches and techniques in a lab environment, and participate in the evolution of emerging media. In 2016-2017, the course will give you the opportunity to engage with wearable immersive virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays on both practical and theoretical levels to understand, create and imagine new kinds of worlds. </p>
<p>You will work in the lab to build prototypes that will function as a testing ground. You are encouraged to be both theorists and practical experimenters, to research while doing, understanding that the process of exploring firsthand is an important step toward the kinds of knowledge and ways of knowing enabled and encouraged by these evocative new digital technologies, and suggest new ways to think about future forms of the moving image, from new literacies to new audiences. The course will expose you to the imperfect software support for building worlds, and encourage you to think about and beyond their limits. Our work is put into context and guided by a century of preceding theory and practice even as we try, collectively, to imagine moving images and screens of the future, through discussions interwoven with the individual and group projects.</p>
<p>Students with backgrounds in film, digital media, design, theatre, music, architecture, video production, and visual storytelling are welcome, as are students with programming, human-computer interaction, or computer graphics backgrounds. Knowledge of some kind of interactive and/or 3D software tools is an advantage, but is not required, as lab instruction in the necessary tools will be given. Above all, curiosity, open-ness, and immediacy of creative thinking are the most important assets that you can bring. This seminar and its associated lab component are understood to be an experimental think tank whose success very much depends on your collective enthusiasm and active engagement.</p>
