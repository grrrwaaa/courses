# Max

> A full kit of creative tools for sound, graphics, music and interactivity in a visual environment.

[30 day demo is free](https://cycling74.com/downloads/). [Max is USD$10/month, or for students, USD$60/year or USD$250 forever.](https://cycling74.com/shop/)

For Windows, 32-bit version is recommended. 

Max is one of the most widely-used platforms for computer music and interactive/digital media art. It originated in work at IRCAM, a computer music laboratory in Paris, over 20 years ago.

MSP added real-time audio. Jitter added 2D and 3D graphics. Gen added run-time code generation. [The worldmaking package](https://github.com/worldmaking/Max_Worldmaking_Package) adds support for virtual reality.

> After installing Max itself, go to [https://github.com/worldmaking/Max_Worldmaking_Package](https://github.com/worldmaking/Max_Worldmaking_Package), press "Clone or Download", and select "Download ZIP". Once it has downloaded, unzip it and move the "Max_Worldmaking_Package" into "My Documents\Max 7\Packages". 

A Max document is called a "patcher", in deference to the inspiration of modular synthesizers and other devices patched together using physical cables. In Max you create objects, which represent processes and UI, and connect them with virtual "cables". This creates paths of data flowing between processes. It is called visual data-flow programming. Jitter manages 3D via the industry-standard OpenGL library, but presents it in terms of Max objects.
