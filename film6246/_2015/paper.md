# Final paper

In view of the current labour dispute conditions, the final project is no longer mandatory; an alternate option to submit a paper is  also available. Nevertheless it remains important to continue to follow the lectures, which are posted online on the [project](project.html) page, in order to ensure proper technical grounds for your paper, regardless of type. 

There are two primary options for the paper:

1. An academic paper addressing major themes of the course.
2. A project proposal for a new VR world/experience, fleshed out with as much detail as possible.

Collections of reading resources are listed on the [reading](reading.html) page. Almost all include links to texts or excerpts available online; others should be available in the library. 

In your paper, make reference to existing VR experiences, and also [videogames](game.html), films, or interactive artworks as appropriate.  

If you have a different idea for a paper, that does not fit the options here, please contact me to discuss it.

## Option 1: Academic paper

Your paper will address one or more of the following questions or arguments. Inevitably it will also involve the need to characterize the unique capabilities, capacities, tendencies and singular points of the medium -- and perhaps thence its McLuhanian message(s). You can also address some of these questions by performing a detailed critical analysis of one or more existing VR experiences.

- What does the imminent explosion of virtual reality (VR), soon to be available as consumer technology, mean for the future of cinema -- in theory, in practices and industries, in genres and literacies, in cultures & audiences, etc.?

- The rising boom in VR activity has been likened to the birth of a new medium.  What valuable insights can be gleaned by drawing comparison with the births and evolutions of prior media, including film and videogames?

- This is not the first time VR has entered public consciousness. The media attention given VR is not dissimilar to that given to VR two decades ago. What are the critical factors that could make or break VR's success this time? Are there significant differences in the cultural context for VR today?

- A significant number of VR experiences are currently being created by artists with strong roots in videogames, as well as interactive art. Theories, methods, and unique modes of expression have yet to be established. As with any emerging medium, a willingness to break rules and abandon habits is necessary. What must these creators learn from film, and what must they forget? Similarly, what must filmmakers learn, and learn to forget, in order to fully address the VR medium? 

- In particular, several components central to classical and mainstream filmmaking appear to be entirely contradicted in VR, including: 1) Engaged interaction leading to nonlinear narrative unfolding uniquely for each immersant, rather than passive viewing of a fixed narrative and timeline. 2) The near-disappearance of the frame as boundary to what is seen -- immersants can look in any direction they please. 3) The inappropriateness of shots divided by cuts, which are jarring and nauseating in VR. Nevertheless, the metaphor of film is immediately apparent when using a game engine such as Unity: there is a setting, there are props, lights, characters, cameras, screen-based special effects etc. Reflect critically upon these contradictions and metaphors to achieve a more nuanced cinema-informed perspective upon VR. Are the strong cinematic metaphors in Unity appropriate for VR? Are there more complex correlates of narrative, frame and shot for VR? Are there historical practices in film that serve as better reference points to understand VR? Or, alternatively, present the case for abandoning film concepts when addressing VR, and what should take their place.

- Reflect upon some of the inherent (or apparent) weaknesses of the VR medium, and suggest how these may influence the practice and content (or even genres) to come, and/or how they may be addressed. Here are some examples. 1) The capture of 3D panoramic and stereographic footage appears to be currently highly impractical, if not in the limit impossible (especially if free navigation is involved). 2) VR is often regarded as a solipsistic, anti-social medium (the Facebook buyout notwithstanding!), despite social activity being one of the most engaging forms of interaction humans enjoy. 3) VR has been criticized for being disembodied, or reinforcing Cartesian dualism with preference to the mind. In many experiences, looking down you see no body -- in others there is a body that is not your own. 

- What is the ultimate experience for VR? Develop an argument that leads from the current situation toward this destination.

## Option 2: A brief and proposal for a new kind of world/experience

To better imagine the moving images and screens of the future, draft a detailed proposal for a new kind of world/experience. This proposal will incorporate as many elements typical of film, computer game, and interactive art as are appropriate to VR. I'm sure you are aware of the typical formats of a film proposal. [Game proposals share some similarities](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2911/the_game_proposal_part_one_the_.php). You will need to choose what elements of film/game proposals are appropriate for your project.
However, as an imaginary project, there is no need to include any budgetary or personnel aspects typical to proposals. 

The primary goal is to convey the innovation in the project, and map its projected realization. The proposal will be graded well if it presents a novel idea, is fully thought-through in terms of the medium and technology of VR, and is well-presented. The format of the proposal can be either:

- Sub-option A) A textual document including diagrams, sketches and reference images. 
- Sub-option B) A video (3-6 minutes) and web-page suitable for an imaginary crowd-funding framework such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc.

Essential to include:

- General format of the experience
- Target audience
- Goal/purpose
- Setting (background)
- Synopsis
- Interaction (navigation, actions, scene/state flow diagram)
- Style (visual, sonic, interactive)
- How this project differs from existing experiences
- Why it must be experienced through VR; and how it addresses the inherent nature of VR
- Technology & project plan (in broad strokes) -- an outline of how the concept will be achieved; major phases, mandatory and desirable requirements, etc.

Also you may flesh out significant material parts of the proposal:

- Script fragments, or fragments of a treatment
- Descriptions of key art materials (or samples)
- Descriptions of music, soundtrack, narration etc. (or samples)
- Material sources
- World details, history, characters, flora/fauna etc. (as appropriate) 
- Et cetera.
