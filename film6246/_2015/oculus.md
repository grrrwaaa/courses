The Oculus Rift is a virtual reality head-mounted display being developed by Oculus VR. Starting with a phenomenally successful Kickstarter campaign in 2012, and during its period as an independent company, Oculus VR raised US$2.4 million for the development of the Rift. It was then purchased by Facebook for $2 billion. 

The consumer version of the product is expected to become available in Spring 2016. Oculus released two 'development kits', DK1 in late 2012 and DK2 in mid 2014, to give developers a chance to develop content in time for the Rift's release; these have also been purchased by many virtual reality enthusiasts for general usage.

## "Experiences"

- Sightline - Mainly passive, oneiric. A very interesting way of changing scenes. Psychological. 
- Senza Peso - "mini VR opera" - archetypal magic landscapes, at limits of real-time rendering, slow roller coaster, smoke ring cuts.
- Eden River - ambient/relaxation

Saschka Unseld (The Blue Umbrella): "For the type of storytelling I’m currently interested in, I think interactivity is a problem. User-decided story threads are a problem. The audience is a horrible storyteller."

## Technology tips

[How time warping works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvtEXMlQQtI) -- essentially, in the last stage after rendering the scene, we grab the head tracking data once again and warp the image slightly to account for this difference. Warping uses the depth buffer to re-project each pixel from its XYZ position and the new camera position. If we restrict warping to rotation, there are no gaps due to occlusion. 

[Solving motion blur with low persistence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=HoLHHUdi_LE#t=341) -- essentially, the screen is black most of the time, and the image per frame is actually only displayed for around a millisecond; this ensures that the image is rarely in the wrong place as you turn your head, reducing the apparent blur.
