<h2 id="software-for-worldmaking">Software for Worldmaking</h2>
<p>Creating a VR world requires high-performance computer graphics supported by low-level drivers and libraries. Few developers want to work at this level, so a number of higher-level programming frameworks exist -- for new media artists these might still use a lower level language such as C++ (openFrameworks, Cinder being two good examples), or might present a completely different high-level interface such as the visual programming of Max/MSP/Jitter, VVVV, etc. </p>
<p>However the majority of VR experiences are programmed using <em>game engines</em>. The most widely used and freely available game engines used today are <a href="http://unity3d.com">Unity</a> and <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/blog">Unreal</a>. Game Engines can get you a long way by just importing assets, dragging &amp; dropping, tweaking parameters etc. without having to ever see code, and some have some kind of visual programming option too. Though they don&#39;t grant the full freedom of a programming framework, the learning curve is gentler. Compared to many frameworks, game engines have much more built-in features (lighting models, terrain, physics, etc.). The danger is that these engines and their editors are permeated by game-oriented concepts, terminology, workflows etc, and the result is often recognizably the product of a game engine. They also benefit from the largest VR communities at present.</p>
<p>As an alternative to creating an <em>app</em>, some VR creators are focusing on the <em>web browser</em> as primary medium. Unity and Unreal also offer options to export to web, but this might not yet be VR-capable. Alternatively, numerous 3D graphics frameworks exist for browser-based JavaScript (e.g. Three.js), which can be combined with <a href="http://mozvr.com">MozVR</a> for Firefox or <a href="http://webvr.info">WebVR</a> for Firefox &amp; Chrome.</p>
<p>Another option is to avoid software development altogether, and work within a sandbox platform: a game or game-like world that already exists, but which can be redefined by its users to build and design &quot;user generated content&quot; (such as SecondLife -- see <a href="http://secondlife.com/destinations/oculus">this collection of Rift-oriented examples</a>). Obviously this may appear the easiest, but is also the most constrained of the available options.</p>
<p>For our labs we will begin with the game engine route, with the Unreal Engine in particular.</p>
<h1 id="unreal-engine">Unreal Engine</h1>
<p>Unreal has long been used in many &quot;AAA&quot; (large-scale/high-production value/high-budget) games, but was recently open-sourced with an amenable license in early 2015; and now has built-in support for VR and the Oculus Rift (just press Alt + Enter!)</p>
<h2 id="getting-unreal">Getting Unreal</h2>
<p>Create an account on www.unrealengine.com and download the Unreal launcher application. Launch the launcher (need to sign in again), and then under the &quot;Unreal&quot; tab download the Unreal Engine. This will take a while.</p>
<p>You probably want to also download the Content Examples, and some other items. Warning -- the examples can eat gigabytes of disk space!!</p>
