# Game

Looking at [share.oculus.com](http://share.oculus.com) it is clear that the current main thrust of content is still games. Nevertheless, the games that *work* in VR are not necessarily the same as those that work on the console, PC, tablet etc. And within the collection there are some remarkable *experiences* that stretch the typical expectations of video games. 

## What exactly is a game?

Pr&eacute;cis, Chapter 1, [Reality is Broken. Jane McGonigal. 2001](http://janemcgonigal.com/my-book/):

- "game" and "player" are currently culturally pejorative terms
	- reflect fear of losing track of where game ends and reality begins
- incredible diversity of what games can be, within & beyond digital media
- despite diversity, there are four defining traits of games:
	- **goal(s)**: outcomes to achieve, focusing attention and orienting partipation. *Purpose*. 
	- **rules**: limitations on how goals can be achieved. "Rules push players to explore previously uncharted possibility spaces. They unleash creativity and foster strategic thinking."
	- **feedback system**: Tells players how close they are to achieving goals. Points, levels, scores, progress bars, "the game is over when...", etc. A *promise* of achievability, and a *motivation* to continue playing.
	- **voluntary participation**: All players knowingly and willingly accept the goal, rules, and feedback. A common ground for participation. Freedom to enter/leave establishes a *safe* and *pleasurable* activity.
- everything else, things that could be common features, are there to enhance these four traits
	- *immersive graphics increase our ability to pay sustained attention*
- Bernard Suits sums it up: **"Playing a game is the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles."**
	- JM later paraphrases: *"any well-designed game is an invitation to tackle an unnecessary obstacle"*
- JM works through traits in a diversity of examples: 
	- golf: choosing to make the work of getting a ball into a hall more difficult.
	- Scrabble: "freedom to work in the most logical and efficient way is the very *opposite* of gameplay"
	- Tetris: 
		- Variety and intensity of feedback is what differentiates digital and non-digital games. You can feel how attentive the game is. Brings you to very limits of [flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). 
		- Most addictive game, but you can't ever win. Competition and winning are *not* defining features of games. Related to [infinite games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games)
	- Portal: The goal in the first scene is to find out what the goal is. Common strategy today (gamers don't read manuals). In each puzzle you have to teach yourself the physics (the rules). Four traits are there, but in a different order. We are given feedback first, rather than goal + rules. [Somebody playing Portal 2 on the Oculus Rift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DmUA9N99X8)
- If a goal is compelling, the feedback is motivating, players will wrestle with the limitations creatively, sincerely, seriously, and enthusiastically for a long time (until exhausted). This is being *"gameful"*. 
- Why do unnecessary obstacles make us happy? [JM is building an argument for *gamification*]
	- Hard work that we choose to do.
		- Diversity of hard work games offer: **high-stakes work, busywork, mental work, physical work, discovery work, teamwork, creative work**.
	- The opposite of play isn't work. It's depression: pessimistic sense of inadequacy, despondent lack of activity. 
		- reversed: optimistic sense of capabilities, invigorating rush of activity. Sounds like gameplay.
		- playing activates all neurological/physiological systems of  happiness: attention systems, reward center, motivation systems, emotion & memory centers 
	- We resent hard work we don't choose to do. It stresses us, or bores us, etc. [It doesn't match us.] 	
	- Psychologists found that relaxing fun (tv, chocolate, window-shopping etc.) doesn't make us feel better; mildly depressing. *We seek passive/low-engagement experiences to counterbalance overstimulation/overwhelmedness* but we overdo it. 
		- better to seek "hard fun", *"eustress"*, in which there is no real danger or failure
		- Tal Ben-Shahar: **"we're much happier *enlivening* time rather than killing time."**
		- *Fiero*: possibly the most primal emotional rush we can experience. Italian for pride, adopted by game designers. Triumph over adversity. One of the most powerful neurochemical highs we can experience.
- *"A good game is a unique way of structuring experience and provoking positive emotion."* [Even horror games]
	- JM gamification moral: motivate hard work, inspire participation, of millions, by giving well-designed games to play instead of systems for people to "game", to make a better world.

> "a form of entertainment that really doesn't have a winner, or even a real conclusion" - Nintendo president Satoru Iwata

The most famous large-scale industry examples are SimCity and Second Life, but recently there has been a lot more active creativity outside the normal bounds of gaming, especially coming from the indie community, and more widely considered close to [games-as-art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_games_as_an_art_form).

> Now that there’s so much willingness, technology and skill to create beautiful virtual worlds, it’s disappointing how many videogames cling to obstacle-based designs. As if players have to earn the privilege to explore by passing an irrelevant test. Now is the time to open up this medium, to let go of our affections and addictions, of our loyalty to childhood memories, to open up the beauty of videogames for the world to see... Let design mean the building of bridges and the opening of doors, not the hiding of keys and the cowardly sniper shot. (Michael Samyn, TaleOfTales)

> "One obvious difference between art and games is that you can win a game. It has rules, points, objectives, and an outcome. Santiago might cite a [sic] immersive game without points or rules, but I would say then it ceases to be a game and becomes a representation of a story, a novel, a play, dance, a film. Those are things you cannot win; you can only experience them." [Roger Ebert, "Video games can never be art"](http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/video-games-can-never-be-art). *(Ebert later conceded that games may indeed be art in a non-traditional sense.)*



### Proteus

[Proteus](http://www.visitproteus.com) is an "open world exploration game". **It has no specific goals.** Every creature and plant has a unique musical signature. The game world is procedurally generated, creating a unique layout each game. Non-realistic 8-bit style. Slow-paced.
