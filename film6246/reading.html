<blockquote>
<p>Rare is the work of philosophy that invites both the casual reader and the academic. Rare, too, is the text so universal that luminaries across an array of fields lay claim to it. Yet, that is precisely the case with Gaston Bachelard’s The Poetics of Space. A rumination on the spaces we inhabit and the dreams and memories that fill them, this seminal work continues to be studied and enjoyed by philosophers, architects, writers, and literary theorists alike.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We live in a physical world whose properties we have come to know well through long familiarity. We sense an involvement with this physical world which gives us the ability to predict its properties well. For example, we can predict where objects will fall, how well-known shapes look from other angles, and how much force is required to push objects against friction. We lack corresponding familiarity with the forces on charged particles, forces in non-uniform fields, the effects of nonprojective geometric transformations, and high-inertia, low friction motion. A display connected to a digital computer gives us a chance to gain familiarity with concepts not realizable in the physical world. It is a looking glass into a mathematical wonderland. Computer displays today cover a variety of capabilities. Some have only the fundamental ability to plot dots. Displays being sold now generally have built in line-drawing capability. An ability to draw simple curves would be useful. Some available displays are able to plot very short line segments in arbitrary directions, to form characters or more complex curves. Each of these abilities has a history and a known utility.

<blockquote>
<p>Expanded Cinema by Gene Youngblood (1970), the first book to consider video as an art form, was influential in establishing the field of media arts.[1] In the book he argues that a new, expanded cinema is required for a new consciousness. He describes various types of filmmaking utilizing new technology, including film special effects, computer art, video art, multi-media environments and holography.</p>
<p>&quot;When we say expanded cinema we actually mean expanded consciousness. Expanded cinema does not mean computer films, video phosphors, atomic light, or spherical projections. Expanded cinema isn’t a movie at all: like life its’ a process of becoming, mans’ ongoing historical drive to manifest his consciousness outside of his mind, in front of his eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>Brethren, Welcome to the First Church of Jesus, Lord of Virtual Space, where you, like Thomas, can thrust your hand in the wound of Christ. You can absolve your sins by taking up His cross on the way to Golgotha. The Church of Jesus, Lord of Virtual Space can deliver to you what the faithful and non-believers alike have yearned for for so many generations: Proof! Here and now I want to extend an invitation to each and every one of you to join me, each Sunday, in the comfort and privacy of your own home, in the most scientific, the most up to date, religious experience that is available today. Join me every sunday as we live the life of Christ together. You can witness the sermon on the mount, the betrayal in the garden of gethsemany; you&#39;ll hear the cock crow, you will be there! Don your holy eyephones and come with me, through the chapels of the stations of the cross, suffer with your savior, take Christ into your heart, and step into the body of Christ. Then join me in virtual communion, where angels will pass you golden goblets direct from the flowing wounds of the crucified christ! For only $599 and a low monthly rental, you can visit the Kingdom of the Lord (or something very like it), every Sunday. Our Fathers&#39; house has many mansions, and I want to show you just a few of them. Picture if you will, this scene: in living rooms across the country, a parish of believers wearing eyephones, negotiating invisible obstacles, falling on their knees. But inside the eyephones its a different world, the streets are sandy, the sun near- eastern hot, the crowd is yelling as Pilate hands down his judgement. A Christian virtual theme park.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bill Viola has been one of the highest-profile of video artists, allowing him to create, in recent years, what some have called &quot;70 millimeter&quot; video art—work in which video&#39;s lower cost is not a primary attraction for the artist, and the traditionally rough production values of video art are not present. However, what has remained consistent from Viola&#39;s grittier early work to his massive late-1990s retrospective at the Whitney Museum is a poetic approach to exploring the video medium. As Michael Rush wrote in his New Media in Late 20th Century Art, &quot;Bill Viola&#39;s work, perhaps more than any other, represents the tendency toward the lyrical in art&quot;. This view of Viola&#39;s work is perhaps instructive when considering the essay reprinted here—for example, during his discussion of the MIT Media Lab&#39;s famous Aspen Movie-Map. The project was brilliant, but limited by the fact that it was structured around a video hardware hack (as discussed in Andrew Lippman&#39;s paper from SIGGRAPH 1980) which was mapped onto a navigation system meant to be as familiar as possible, so as to bring something already imagined to life. It remained for artists to seek, instead, surprise, and to create defamiliarizing forms of interaction that would allow the technology to be envisioned anew, instead of as a step toward making real what we already expected.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Computers have dramatically altered life in the late twentieth century. Today we can draw on worldwide computer links, speeding up communications by radio, newspapers, and television. Ideas fly back and forth and circle the globe at the speed of electricity. And just around the corner lurks full-blown virtual reality, in which we will be able to immerse ourselves in a computer simulation not only of the actual physical world, but of any imagined world. As we begin to move in and out of a computer-generated world, Michael Heim asks, how will the way we perceive our world change?</p>

This book brings together critical essays along with artists&#39; projects to explore the many issues raised by the creation of virtual environments and to provide a glimpse into worlds that have been much discussed but rarely seen. The book opens with eleven essays that approach the social and cultural implications of cyberspace from the perspective of cultural studies, communications, art history, art criticism, English, and women&#39;s studies. These are followed by nine virtual environments (along with statements of what the artists are trying to accomplish in both theoretical and technical terms), created as part of the Art and Virtual Environments Project at the Banff Centre.</p>

<p>I have been working in &quot;virtual space&quot; for nearly 10 years, and during that time have produced two major works, the virtual environments Osmose (1995) and Ephémère (1998)[1]. Integrating full body immersion, interactive 3D digital imagery and sound, and navigation via a breathing interface, these works embody a radically alternative approach to immersive virtual space, or what is commonly known as &quot;virtual reality&quot; or &quot;VR&quot;. Rather than approaching the medium as a means of escape into some disembodied techno-Utopian fantasy, I see it as a means of return, i.e., of facilitating a temporary release from our habitual perceptions and culturally-biased assumptions about being in the world, to enable us, however momentarily, to perceive ourselves and the world around us freshly.</p>

<p>In this book Lev Manovich offers the first systematic and rigorous theory of new media. He places new media within the histories of visual and media cultures of the last few centuries. He discusses new media&#39;s reliance on conventions of old media, such as the rectangular frame and mobile camera, and shows how new media works create the illusion of reality, address the viewer, and represent space. He also analyzes categories and forms unique to new media, such as interface and database. Manovich uses concepts from film theory, art history, literary theory, and computer science and also develops new theoretical constructs, such as cultural interface, spatial montage, and cinegratography. The theory and history of cinema play a particularly important role in the book. Among other topics, Manovich discusses parallels between the histories of cinema and of new media, digital cinema, screen and montage in cinema and in new media, and historical ties between avant-garde film and new media.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although many people view virtual reality as a totally new phenomenon, it has its foundations in an unrecognized history of immersive images. Indeed, the search for illusionary visual space can be traced back to antiquity. In this book, Oliver Grau shows how virtual art fits into the art history of illusion and immersion. He describes the metamorphosis of the concepts of art and the image and relates those concepts to interactive art, interface design, agents, telepresence, and image evolution. Grau retells art history as media history, helping us to understand the phenomenon of virtual reality beyond the hype. Grau shows how each epoch used the technical means available to produce maximum illusion. He discusses frescoes such as those in the Villa dei Misteri in Pompeii and the gardens of the Villa Livia near Primaporta, Renaissance and Baroque illusion spaces, and panoramas, which were the most developed form of illusion achieved through traditional methods of painting and the mass image medium before film. Through a detailed analysis of perhaps the most important German panorama, Anton von Werner&#39;s 1883 The Battle of Sedan, Grau shows how immersion produced emotional responses. He traces immersive cinema through Cinerama, Sensorama, Expanded Cinema, 3-D, Omnimax and IMAX, and the head mounted display with its military origins. He also examines those characteristics of virtual reality that distinguish it from earlier forms of illusionary art. His analysis draws on the work of contemporary artists and groups ART+COM, Maurice Benayoun, Charlotte Davies, Monika Fleischmann, Ken Goldberg, Agnes Hegedues, Eduardo Kac, Knowbotic Research, Laurent Mignonneau, Michael Naimark, Simon Penny, Daniela Plewe, Paul Sermon, Jeffrey Shaw, Karl Sims, Christa Sommerer, and Wolfgang Strauss. Grau offers not just a history of illusionary space but also a theoretical framework for analyzing its phenomenologies, functions, and strategies throughout history and into the future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In his article «System Stories and Model Worlds: A Critical Approach To Generative Art» Mitchell Whitelaw Canberra(AUS) proposes to bridge what has been detected by various authors, the unproductive gap between «software formalism» and «software culturalism». While formalism tends to be visually abstract, and thus corresponds to the field of generative art, the culturalist approach, on the other side, suggests that software art is predomi- nantly critical/political, focusing on and deconstructing software as cultural text. Refusing what he calls binary thinking, Mitchell Whitelaw instead proposes to overcome this split by calling for a «critical generativity». Such an approach would deconstruct the system stories contained in the formal objects used by generative art and thus would critically analyze their implications. To put it shortly, it would allow to «read generative software art according to the critical paradigm of the software culturalists» (Whitelaw).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In From Technological to Virtual Art, respected historian of art and technology Frank Popper traces the development of immersive, interactive new media art from its historical antecedents through today&#39;s digital, multimedia, and networked art. Popper shows that contemporary virtual art is a further refinement of the technological art of the late twentieth century and also a departure from it. What is new about this new media art, he argues, is its humanization of technology, its emphasis on interactivity, its philosophical investigation of the real and the virtual, and its multisensory nature. He argues further that what distinguishes the artists who practice virtual art from traditional artists is their combined commitment to aesthetics and technology. Their &quot;extra-artistic&quot; goals—linked to their aesthetic intentions—concern not only science and society but also basic human needs and drives. Defining virtual art broadly as art that allows us, through an interface with technology, to immerse ourselves in the image and interact with it, Popper identifies an aesthetic-technological logic of creation that allows artistic expression through integration with technology. After describing artistic forerunners of virtual art from 1918 to 1983—including art that used light, movement, and electronics—Popper looks at contemporary new media forms and artists. He surveys works that are digital based but materialized, multimedia offline works, interactive digital installations, and multimedia online works (net art) by many artists, among them John Maeda, Jenny Holzer, Brenda Laurel, Agnes Hegedus, Stelarc, and Igor Stromajer. The biographical details included reinforce Popper&#39;s idea that technology is humanized by art. Virtual art, he argues, offers a new model for thinking about humanist values in a technological age.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this first book-length study of the internationally renowned Canadian artist Char Davies, Laurie McRobert examines the digital installations Osmose and Ephémère in the context of Davies&#39; artistic and conceptual inspirations. Davies, originally a painter, turned to technology in an effort to create the effect of osmosis between self and world. By donning a head-mounted display unit and a body vest to monitor breathing and balance, participants are immersed in 3D-virtual space where they interact with abstract images of nature while manoeuvring in an artificial spatial environment. Char Davies&#39; Immersive Virtual Art and the Essence of Spatiality explores spatiality through a broad scope of disciplines, including philosophy, mythology, biology, and visual studies, in order to familiarize the reader with virtual reality art - how it differs from traditional artistic media and why immersive virtual art promises to expand our imaginative horizons. This original study provides us with an important exposition of two of Char Davies&#39; acclaimed projects and an exploration of the future impact of digital virtual art on our worldviews.</p>

<p>The concept of a “strange ontology” is articulated via the intersection of philosophical and computational definitions of ontology. Within digital media, each simulated world requires both; an ontology, to define its existence as data; and a subject, the player or user, who engages with the simulation. Glitches or interventions in these simulations create ontologies that are inconsistent with our lived experience, rendering them “strange.” We draw upon a range of works to illustrate this concept, including game art, social networking software, Guglielmetti&#39;s “Laboratories of though” and generative art. This article aims to define this concept and outlines a terrain for further investigation.</p>

<p>Carse, James. Finite and infinite games. Simon and Schuster, 2011. <em><a href="http://wtf.tw/ref/carse.pdf">Chapter 1 Seen here</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With this philosophy text, Carse demonstrates a way of looking at actions in life as being a part of at least two types of what he describes as &quot;games&quot;, finite and infinite. Both games are played within rules, as agreed upon by the participants; however, the meaning of the rules is different for the two types of games. The book stresses a non-serious (or &quot;playful&quot;) view of life on the part of &quot;players&quot;, referring to their choices as &quot;moves&quot;, and societal constructs and mores as &quot;rules&quot; and &quot;boundaries&quot;. He regularly employs familiar terms in specialized ways, but casts them as associated with finite or infinite play &amp; players. Boundaries are &quot;rules&quot; that one must stay within when playing a finite game, in contrast with horizons, which move with the player, and are constantly changing as he or she &quot;plays&quot;. In short, a finite game is played with the purpose of winning (thus ending the game), while an infinite game is played with the purpose of continuing the play.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beginning in the late eighteenth century, huge circular panoramas presented their audiences with resplendent representations that ranged from historic battles to exotic locations. Such panoramas were immersive but static. There were other panoramas that moved--hundreds, and probably thousands of them. Their history has been largely forgotten. In Illusions in Motion, Erkki Huhtamo excavates this neglected early manifestation of media culture in the making. The moving panorama was a long painting that unscrolled behind a “window” by means of a mechanical cranking system, accompanied by a lecture, music, and sometimes sound and light effects. Showmen exhibited such panoramas in venues that ranged from opera houses to church halls, creating a market for mediated realities in both city and country. In the first history of this phenomenon, Huhtamo analyzes the moving panorama in all its complexity, investigating its relationship to other media and its role in the culture of its time. In his telling, the panorama becomes a window for observing media in operation. Huhtamo explores such topics as cultural forms that anticipated the moving panorama; theatrical panoramas; the diorama; the &quot;panoramania&quot; of the 1850s and the career of Albert Smith, the most successful showman of that era; competition with magic lantern shows; the final flowering of the panorama in the late nineteenth century; and the panorama&#39;s afterlife as a topos, traced through its evocation in literature, journalism, science, philosophy, and propaganda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyone can master the fundamentals of game design - no technological expertise is necessary. The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses shows that the same basic principles of psychology that work for board games, card games and athletic games also are the keys to making top-quality videogames. Good game design happens when you view your game from many different perspectives, or lenses. While touring through the unusual territory that is game design, this book gives the reader one hundred of these lenses - one hundred sets of insightful questions to ask yourself that will help make your game better. These lenses are gathered from fields as diverse as psychology, architecture, music, visual design, film, software engineering, theme park design, mathematics, writing, puzzle design, and anthropology. Anyone who reads this book will be inspired to become a better game designer - and will understand how to do it.</p>

<p>Let no one say otherwise, shooting 360 video is difficult and intense! It’s a medium that has completely unique challenges. And that is exciting for both the tech folk and the storytellers. But you’ll need to understand the many hurdles so that you can soar. Knowing the specific details, inherent limitations, and potential problems will only help to inform how to successfully create immersion. And that is what this book aims to do! We know technology will evolve exponentially, softwares will update, hardware will become smaller, lighter, and more efficient. The chapters we have written thus far could be irrelevant as of yesterday. so please continually constantly self-develop with us.</p>
