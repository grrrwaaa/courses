<h2 id="groups-">Groups?</h2>
<p>Making a world is a large effort. You may wish to create projects within smaller groups, or everybody contribute to a single project.</p>
<p>Breaking up into roles, and/or levels (sub-worlds or regions)?</p>
<p>Most generally speaking, building a world requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design (concept, story, mechanics &amp; interaction, directorial decision-making)</li>
<li>Engineering (implementation of mechanics, procedural elements, and working around constraints)</li>
<li>Art (visual, sonic, spatial etc. asset creation and placement)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="points-of-departure">Points of departure</h2>
<p>Here are a set of questions that may help you come up with a design proposal for the project. Mainly these are questions specific to the interactive/VR nature of the medium, but of course concepts from other media (film, game, etc.) can be equally useful.</p>
<p>These questions may be filtered according to a project theme, or considering them may lead to the development of a theme. Overall these should form a unity, or a multiplicity with a centre. Also, as a result, an appropriate division of expected work will likely arise.</p>
<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>How do you contextualize the project? Original artspaces as an experience to navigate through? Unique games with rules in a reward oriented manner?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How does this idea respond to the question of the medium -- how is it specific to VR, and wouldn&#39;t make sense (or much less sense) without VR? How does it use the basic elements of the medium, and the engine, as fundamental to the message?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Where does it sit between the spectrum of a fixed narrative arc to a completely open interaction?</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed time or interactively-paced?</li>
<li>Goal oriented or otherwise driven? “rewards” as a way to “push” the participant to continue?</li>
<li>If there is narrative-by-location, how do you lead/attract the immersant through key points?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What is the overal tone of the experience (what primal emotions, physical and mental states are elicited, what kind of activities does it resemble, what kind of attitude is required)? </p>
</li>
<li><p>What metaphors, allusions, poetics of space or time?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What are the major influences, sources of inspiration, outside the medium?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What are the arcs of time, beginnings &amp; ends? Are there challenges &amp; rewards/failures? What is the overall rhythm, flow, and temporal tone of the piece? Is it a branching narrative, are there time constraints/limits, is there circularity, or open-ness -- how would it look as a diagram?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What are the hooks? (Easily graspable and seductive uniqueness), Does it flip expectations?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What&#39;s the one-sentence elevator pitch / one-paragraph synopsis?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Why won&#39;t it be boring/dull/discordant/dysfunctional/etc. for all possible points of failure; how must all elements balance tension to create a whole? Remember that <em>elegance</em> or <em>wholeness</em> can defined in terms of <a href="http://www.arch.ksu.edu/seamon/Alexander%20as%20phenomenology%20of%20wholeness%20dec%2008.pdf">the avoidance of failure</a>. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="environment-space">Environment/Space</h3>
<p>What is the general nature of the space -- how does it speak its poetry?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Grounded or other?</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a sense of up? Things like a ground plane, physics of gravity, and visual references (buildings, trees, rooms etc) will anchor the sense of &quot;upness&quot;. Take care to place the user at an appropriate height above ground (by default the space is measured in meters). </li>
<li>The absence of gravity, ground planes, and well-oriented familiar objects will diminish the sense of &quot;upness&quot;, lending instead a sense of space that could be non-terrestrial deep space, deep sea, microscopic space, mathematical or abstract space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>An open (e.g. outdoor) or enclosed (e.g. indoor) space? Both, or other?</p>
<ul>
<li>Enclosed spaces are living environments, caves, dungeons, jungles, tunnels, tubes, vessels etc. Care must be taken to make sure navigation is limited within the enclosed space. There may be partitions between spaces (doors, portals, holes, etc.) In VR, getting scale correct is extremely important. Enclosed spaces can be comforting, but also claustrophobic. Mazes &amp; labyrinths, narratives of hiding, searching, escaping.</li>
<li>Open spaces are deserts, fields, mountain plateaus, the sea (on the surface or below), roadways, the air, deep space, abstract space. Open spaces can be more challenging to fill; it takes effort to ensure they do not primarily convey emptiness (unless that is the goal). If the space is freely navigable, how do you ensure there is something worth experiencing in any direction or location? Some experiences use &quot;procedural generation&quot;, which means using an algorithm to generate content wherever the traveller wanders. Some simply repeat content. Most however give the visual impression of open space (via skyboxes for example), but actually limit the range of navigation to stay within certain boundaries, such as walls, cliffs, shores (the island is a very common motif), or some life-threatening danger. Narratives of exploration, journey, loss.</li>
<li>Combine both: an open space with entrances to enclosed spaces, such as buildings or caves (e.g. Dear Esther, but also Minecraft). Narratives of discovery, quest, complexity. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Scene by space?</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there “scenes” or scene-like regions (even if you only produce one in the prototype, you can map out more in the documentation)</li>
<li>Strange geometries (e.g. portals, worlds-within-worlds such as in Technolust, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Scene/set/level/map/world design</p>
<ul>
<li>Depends greatly on freedom of navigation; the more free the immersant, the more it becomes architecture rather than scenography. </li>
<li>Consider paths, affordances, balance, hierarchy, scale &amp; proportion, symmetry &amp; asymmetry, unity, rhythm &amp; emphasis, densities, directions and radial balance, form &amp; function etc.</li>
<li>Static objects are cheaper than dynamic ones.</li>
<li>Human-scale, table-scale, or other? </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="world-behaviour">World-behaviour</h3>
<p>What moves in the world -- what makes it more than a place? Or, is absence/loss part of its character?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Any kinds of mechanics in the world? </p>
<ul>
<li>Physics of solid objects -- shapes, masses, frictions, motors and joints</li>
<li>Physics of fields, particles and volumes -- attractions, winds, explosions, smokes and clouds, water, etc.</li>
<li>Appearances &amp; disappearances</li>
<li>Changes of color, texture, lighting, sounds, etc., even scale?</li>
<li>Day/night cycle?</li>
<li>Weather, disaster (e.g. quake), machines (working or broken), anything dream-like</li>
<li>Events, repetitions, rhythms, polyphonies (think Eisenstein, and visual music)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Any agencies in the world?</p>
<ul>
<li>Machines &amp; Flora -- grasses, trees and other foliage, machines by via physics or algorithmics</li>
<li>Robots &amp; Fauna -- mainly by motions that suggest intention: sudden changes of direction, responsiveness to nearby environment, etc.</li>
<li>People/characters (or people-like things) -- very difficult to even get close to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">uncanny valley</a>, never mind overcome it; but voices &amp; videos are one way, non-realistic avatars are another. Even a tracking CCTV camera imparts life to the world. Simple logic/AI?</li>
<li>Multiplayer?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Does the world itself embody some intelligence, maintaining certain balances or responding adaptively to the immersant?</p>
</li>
<li><p>(How) do these mechanics and agencies influence each other, independently of the immersant?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interaction-navigation">Interaction &amp; Navigation</h3>
<p>What can we do there?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How does an immersant navigate?</p>
<ul>
<li>None -- you can only observe from a single fixed point, though the world may change around you (e.g. Sightline)</li>
<li>None -- but you are transported by cuts or continuously (e.g. Senza Peso)</li>
<li>Path -- you can only move on a fixed path, but you can control the speed (e.g. <a href="http://www.a-way-to-go.com">Way to Go</a>)</li>
<li>Jump/cut -- e.g. look at a location for long enough and you will jump there; or teleport somewhere</li>
<li>Walking (running, jumping)</li>
<li>Driving (cars, boats, planes, spaceships, robots, riding animals etc.)</li>
<li>Flying/swimming</li>
<li>Other?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What devices are used?</p>
<ul>
<li>Only headset tracking</li>
<li>Keyboard, Joystick, etc.</li>
<li>others?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What kinds of actions can be taken in the world? (Almost anything can be made modulable)</p>
<ul>
<li>In specific locations vs. wherever you are?</li>
<li>Actions may have conditions: location, timing, presence of another agent/object, etc.</li>
<li>Actions modulate self, agencies, world, ...</li>
<li>Play with anticipation, engagement, surprise, revelation, ...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What is the driving meaning behind interaction?</p>
<ul>
<li>The act of uncovering/discovering... including mazes and confusions</li>
<li>Unlocking secrets</li>
<li>Collecting</li>
<li>Creative activities</li>
<li>Contemplation/meditation</li>
<li>Others</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Do actions leave permanent traces? (Even between sessions?)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-real-the-virtual">The real &amp; the virtual</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Is there a self-image (avatar)?</p>
<ul>
<li>What does it look like? (How to avoid a sense of alienation?)</li>
<li>Co-located with the immersant (i.e. look down and see a body)</li>
<li>3rd-person viewpoint, e.g. typically behind and above</li>
<li>If using hand tracking, how do hands appear? Only hands or full body?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Realism</p>
<ul>
<li>Some things are easier than others to make look reasonably realistic. Most things human or animal are very difficult. Realism also in terms of physics, lighting, sound. Scale and appropriateness of materials. Avoiding noticing polygons in geometry, flatness of texture, etc.</li>
<li>How to blend elements of the real world into a virtual space? </li>
<li>Incorporate real-world images, footage, audio? Video can be inserted as 2D screens within the 3D world. It can be vignetted, and possibly chroma-keyed, but it will still look flat. Audio recordings can be incorporated very easily, and tend not to break presence as awkwardly. </li>
<li>Non-realistic elements do not necessarily weaken immersion/presence at all, and may even reduce sim-sickness.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-photorealistic_rendering">Non-photorealistic rendering</a>: cel/toon shading (cartoonlike), sketch/watercolor etc., designer-centric/Bauhaus/minimalist etc. (e.g. AntiChamber, White Mask Experiment), digital aesthetic/TRON-like (e.g. Fract), glitch (e.g. Memory of a Broken Dimension), game nostalgia (e.g. Dumpy, Proteus), etc... </li>
<li>Fantasy, antirealism, hyperrealism, psychedelia, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="elements">Elements</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Geometries</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic non-solids: points, lines, planes.</li>
<li>Basic solids; cubes, spheres, capsules, cones, pyramids, stairs, constructive (additive &amp; subtractive) architecture</li>
<li>Solids (meshes) imported from files (possibly including animations)</li>
<li>Foliage-distributed objects</li>
<li>Particles &amp; simple clouds, atmospherics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Light &amp; lighting, and post-processing effects</p>
<ul>
<li>Story by lighting, stark, noir, horror, abstract, monochrome, manga, schematic, etc.</li>
<li>Navigation by unusual lighting/material (e.g. Devil&#39;s Tuning Fork, Unfinished Swan, White Mask Experiment)</li>
<li>Easy: low number of light sources; point, directional and spot lights. Simple homogenous fog. Plastic-like materials.</li>
<li>Shadows, glows (bloom), ambient occlusion, diffractions, water surfaces</li>
<li>Opaque materials are easier. Reflective materials are possible. Very transparent/translucent is fairly easy, but weakly transparent/translucent is trickier. </li>
<li>Impossible views, illusions, etc.?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Sound/music?</p>
<ul>
<li>Spatiality<ul>
<li>located/directional</li>
<li>personal (e.g. breathing, walking, internal monologue),</li>
<li>omnipresent ambience</li>
<li>areas of distinct reverberation</li>
<li>omnipresent non-diegetic sound/music</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Continuous sounds and triggered event sounds</li>
<li>Voices</li>
<li>Adaptive music/sound (responding to state and events in world, even location)</li>
<li>Recorded sounds (and samples and instruments) vs. synthetic sounds and effects</li>
<li>Image-sound correlations and disjunctions; Michel Chion&#39;s l&#39;Audiovision (seen <a href="here">http://monoskop.org/images/6/6d/Chion_Michel_Audio-Vision.pdf</a>) is a significant reference</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Any head-centric overlays or interface objects?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="experience-design-in-games">Experience Design in Games</h2>
<p>We can draw inspiration from <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/The-Art-Game-Design-Edition/dp/1466598646">The Art of Game Design</a> (<a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~lws2/summercamp/Art_Game_Design.pdf">seen here</a>). Although this book <em>is</em> oriented toward games in particular, the approach it takes is broad enough that most elements can be applied to experiences whether game-like or notgame-like. Written by one of the world&#39;s top game designers, it addresses game design holistically through a set of questions drawn in concurrent perspectives, or <em>&quot;lenses&quot;</em>, gradually building up a map that looks like this:</p>
