Notice the framing, dramatization of donning equipment, abstracted via silhouette.

Wonderful [quote](http://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/2353571-la-po-tique-de-l-espace) from [Bachelard's Poetics of Space](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13269.The_Poetics_of_Space)

Enter with "orientation space" -- a Cartesian grid

Gives way to a clearing (dissolve & audio cross-fade)

Clearing & "archetypal tree" 

- Archetypal tree
- Ground layers
- Rocks underneath
- Surround layers (made of planes)
- Particle-fish, follow paths (schooling?) and rise up through tree
- Sounds & soundtrack, depend on location, orientation, speed of visitor

Explicit parallel with deep-sea diving (floating, breathing to rise/fall, leaning to move)

No solid objects, only translucencies 

Transition between "worlds" (scenes?) is spatial dissolve, not just temporal. *Osmosis.* So you can hover between worlds/scenes, occupying the dissolve.

Outer area of clearing becomes dense green foliage, fish become green, music/sound changes.

Deep underground see code (including real-time sensor data), above cloud see poetry 

## Scene map

- Most links are reversible
- There are 3 loops
- Life world (after 15 mins) dissolve: object <-> world

# Writing

[Osmose: Notes on Being in Immersive Virtual Space](osmose.pdf)

> These notes were developed during the process of conceptualising and realising the immersive virtual environment, Osmose (1994-1995)

- communicate not only her vision of world, but which **demonstrates medium's potential**, and "aspects related to the medium of "virtual reality" that are often overlooked"

[Rethinking VR: Key Concepts and Concerns](rethinkingvr.pdf)

> The author calls for a subversion of conventional approaches to VR on the basis that they reinforce an outdated dualist worldview. She redefines immersive virtual space as a medium for de-habituating perception and re-sensitizing us to our own being in the world.
