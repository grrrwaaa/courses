<h2 id="the-legible-city-shaw-jeffrey-1988-">The Legible City. Shaw, Jeffrey, 1988.</h2>
<iframe width="720" height="540" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/61l7Y4MS4aU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p><a href="http://www.jeffrey-shaw.net/html_main/show_work.php?record_id=83">See documentation here</a></p>
<p>The sentences refer to the reality of the mentioned cities, downtown Manhattan and the Old City of Amsterdam. In New York, eight texts, monologues of personalities linked to the city. In Amsterdam, they are historical records of the city. </p>
<p>It is conceived as a break from cinema, in which the image is directed by the choice of the viewer (cyclist). There is also a concept of drift, as an aimless wandering through the city, which attracts and guides you. </p>
<p>Why words? The synthetic image is a language -- it requires algorithm (code), and it is a language town. </p>
<p>It brings together two worlds of physical and virtual. The mechanical phase of the body: &quot;I am the one that activates the machine,&quot; with the machine as imaginary language. </p>
<p>The work puts us in position, it pushes us into a virtual world. But the print run is false, because the city is already given in advance. The idea of freedom is also false, because everything is already pre-calculated, planned ... and foreshadowed. We are increasingly a prisoner of language.</p>

<h2 id="dancing-with-the-virtual-dervish-gromala-novak-sharir-1993-1995-">Dancing with the Virtual Dervish. Gromala, Novak, Sharir. 1993-1995.</h2>
<p>An interactive, visual and dance performance work in virtual environments. Collaborative team of Diana Gromala, visual artist, Marcos Novak, architect and Yacov Sharir, dance choreographer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This landmark artwork in virtual reality (VR) received unprecedented art funding from the National Department of Communication, Canada, and the Banff Center for the Arts. It was one of six selected from an international pool of collaborative groups which includes the foremost media artists and computer scientists working with virtual and communications technologies. This artwork was one of the very first in VR.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marcos Novak elsewhere has maintained that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJzf_EokotM">“the future of cinema is worldmaking”</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The virtual space created by Dancing with the Virtual Dervish provides interaction and chance participation between artists and public. A dancer in goggles and gloves interacts with intelligent and controllable computer generated objects while a series of projections behind the dancer displays those objects. This project explores the mediation of inner and outer vision via technology using algorithmic liquid architecture, and navigable music to construct an open-ended series of interconnected worlds. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The ‘rider’ will wear a head mounted display enabling an interactive wide-angle stereo view of a three-dimensional space.  The space will consist of a model of a topological surface to which the platform is bound and upon which it is free to slide.  The ‘rider’ may traverse the model’s surface by leaning in the direction in which she desires to move.  The amount of lean in a given direction will determine the rate of sliding.” </p>

## World Skin. Maurice Benayoun. 1997-2000.

<a href="http://www.lepixelblanc.co/world-skin">Documentation</a>. Interactive digital artwork. Materials, techniques and processes: Cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE), webcam, camera, printer.

&gt; Armed with cameras, we wander through a three-dimensional space. We encounter a war-torn landscape: destroyed buildings, armed militia, tanks, artillery, débris, the wounded, the mutilated. This selection of photographs and images - originating from many different conflict zones - comprise a universe saturated with a kind of tranquil violence. The soundscape evokes a world in which to breathe is to suffer. We become very aware that our presence, as spectators, could upset this chaotic equilibrium. And yet it’s our actions which will exacerbate the pain we see. We take photographs, and yet here, photography is a lethal weapon. 
&gt; The war-torn country doesn’t have borders. We visit the space like tourists; camera at the ready. We can all centre and capture a moment in this world of agony. But what we photograph thereby ceases to exist. Every photographed object disappears from the scene to be replaced by its white silhouette. The world gradually fades away as more and more photographs are taken. Each photographed image is printed. By the time it’s on paper, it’s no longer on the screen. Only its spectral outline remains; positioned according to the observer’s point of view, it haunts the photographs to come. Our progression through this universe reveals its infinite nature; we reassemble elements in the process of rediscovering them, forever different, chaotic, in an endless tragedy.<br>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/84150219">Gender Swap - Experiment with The Machine to Be Another</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/beanotherlab">BeAnotherLab</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

&gt; Gender Swap is an experiment that uses themachinetobeanother.org/ system as a platform for embodiment experience (a neuroscience technique in which users can feel themselves like if they were in a different body). In order to create the brain ilusion we use the immersive Head Mounted Display Oculus Rift, and first-person cameras. To create this perception, both users have to synchronize their movements. If one does not correspond to the movement of the other, the embodiment experience does not work. It means that both users have to constantly agree on every movement they make. Through out this experiment, we aim to investigate issues like Gender Identity, Queer Theory, feminist technoscience, Intimacy and Mutual Respect.
