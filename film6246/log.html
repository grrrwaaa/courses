<li><p>VR demos. Try out one of the VR experiences, and immediately afterwards, write down as many of your immediate impressions as you can -- whatever they may be.</p>
<ul>
<li>After class, reflect on your first impressions of VR some more, and note down any further insights, observations, or ideas you have.</li>
<li>Research online to find a VR project, or a project you think would be suitable for VR, that you would most like to experience. </li>
<li>Submit your responses and research via <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdTvFMQAeuW5IFj6SKBlc0CC-Z8WjBvSorrOrInU8Ej_izBSw/viewform">the week 1 form</a> -- by Monday Jan 9. </li>

<li>Work through at least the first two <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Videos/PLZlv_N0_O1gasd4IcOe9Cx9wHoBB7rxFl/w4XlBKeE46E/index.html">UE4 Editor Tutorial Videos</a>, following along with your own copy.</li>
<li>If you can, try working through some of the steps of the Level Designer Quick Start Tutorial <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Videos/PLZlv_N0_O1gak1_FoAJVrEGiLIploeF3F/cl_eoVfNDKU/index.html">starting here</a>.</li>

<p>Survey follow up -- very honoured to be among you! Some amazing ideas for projects, a lot of deep engagement with the medium, the experience, the illusion of non-mediation/reality of illusion/mediation, peripheral vision, demystification of sense, linear/nonlinear storytelling, the view through others  and other forms of view, questions of multiple participants, non-constant physics, previewing sculptural installations/lost architecture, virtual travel, data-driven geographic documentary... very excited what may come this semester! Also good to hear some of you want to pursue ideas developed in FC1.</p>
<p>Some interesting specific responses to the VR experience itself:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Colosse</p>
<ul>
<li>one thing that stood out was when the character moved in close to where I had been standing and their spear appeared to go through my body.  That was a jarring moment despite my awareness that it was just an illusion, there was a split second where I felt odd.  That something wasn&#39;t right.  Upon later reflection I kept thinking that maybe I could like to experience more of these moments, the unsettling, uncanny feeling of something not adding up.</li>
<li>(as with my previous experiences in VR) I still feel a level of &quot;disconnect&quot; from the experience. I can see, but I can&#39;t touch, hear or smell, and there is a level of interactivity missing that as of yet, cannot be duplicated digitally. ...not being able to means I am not fully immersed, thereby not fully invested in the experience.</li>
<li>I felt the animations were crude and clunky... I was moved by the size dimensions, especially of the monster, but overall, I felt lost, not knowing what to do, if, indeed, I had a mission at all. </li>
<li>I later considered the fact that this type of VR relies too much upon physically moving in space to properly experience the virtual world. I would like to explore VR development of spaces that do not require any movement, worlds that can be experienced and explored in the mind alone. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The Van Gogh cafe </p>
<ul>
<li>no visceral or emotional effect, no immediate impression beyond the first 30 seconds of &#39;this is pretty&#39; and no lasting impression at all. What impacted me most was the feeling that the piece felt static, not engaging, and made me wonder why the creators had not taken it further in some way to be more immersive. The sound was flat - all I remember is score, no ambience or effects. Characters did not interact or react to my presence. No elements changed as time passed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Surge </p>
<ul>
<li>it did affect me quite strongly. I usually get strongly affected by synchronicity between sound and visuals... </li>
<li>further reflections on my VR experiences were all about what kind of improvements can possibly be implemented to make VR more immersive</li>
<li>felt at a loss for my place in this environment. It seemed pointless to be so successfully ensconced in a world solely for the purpose of observation, but then again, that&#39;s how many of us travel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>(Oculus demo reel) </p>
<ul>
<li><p>There was great detail in his design as well as the design of the environment. Consequently, I had a much more visceral reaction. I completely submitted to the suspension of disbelief and had to consciously bring myself back to the &quot;&quot;real world&quot;&quot; in order to appreciate and critically analyze the work in which I was immersed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I was conscious throughout the experience that others were watching what I was seeing on the monitor, so I was consciously trying to &quot;follow&quot; the action. </p>
</li>
<li>felt like tech demos. </li>
<li>The dinosaur was somewhat frightening, but I was conscious of my body in the &quot;real&quot; world, and didn&#39;t feel like I had room to move around too much. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>(Other)</p>
<ul>
<li>I was hoping to use the hand-held joy-stick more to make my experiences more active and interactive; it served only to open portals and change scenes. </li>
<li>... all seemed to be more passive with varying degrees of artistic style and detail. I&#39;m hoping the VR worlds we will experience and create will provide more opportunities for the user (traveller?) to engage</li>
<li>my experiences with VR have always been a mind altering experience. My body always feels ethereal as if I was experiencing heightened reality... I experience a sense a gamic flow similar to what Mihály Csíkszentmihályi describes. A trance-like state where my actions feel natural and organic.</li>
<li>Once I got out I felt disoriented being back in our world. </li>
<li>I think it&#39;s important to consider sound as part of the immersive experience. </li>
<li>it was &quot;neater&quot; then I thought it would be. However due to the movement restrictions and overall lack of physicality I did feel that I was somewhat removed from the environment. It was more like watching a film then being &quot;somewhere.&quot; Later reflections included being a little shocked that I found it neat and I began thinking about how to get beyond that initial amusement in a meaningful way.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>Since most of you identified Unreal as the likely tool of choice, today we&#39;ll mostly dig in to this software: <a href="unreal.html">Introduction to the Unreal Engine Editor</a></p>
<p>Therefore, this week&#39;s task is to get comfortable with &quot;level editing&quot; in Unreal by using what we learn today to model a space you know well, such as a particular room in your home or studio, perhaps a location from your childhood, or from a film you worked on, or perhaps a location you often return to in recurring dreams...  and if you bring in the result on an external disk or thumbdrive we can explore these spaces in VR next week. </p>
