### Social?

- Is this why Facebook bought Oculus?
- There are already several SecondLifes in development (e.g. AltSpaceVR, Rec Room)
- There are several multiplayer games already (Climbey, Onward, ...)
- There are also already VR arcades (VR Bangs in Korea)

## Augmented and other Mediated forms of Reality 

- Combines real & virtual images (and/or other modalities?) -- in which both may be perceived simultaneously
- Registered in 3D: virtual objects appear fixed in real space
- Virtual content can be interacted with

AR can be visual overlays in glasses, can be real-time video mixed within virtual displays, can be tablet-based windows on the world (Pokemon GO), etc. 

Where VR replaces senses of reality, AR adds to them. At present times AR is less immersive, but this may change in the future.

### Mixed Reality

![ar-vr continuum](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dc/Virtuality_Continuum_2.jpg)

The virtuality continuum ranges between the completely virtual and the completely real. The concept was first introduced by Paul Milgram and Fumio Kishino in 1994. It places both Augmented Reality (including lens, screen, and projected variants) and Virtual Reality (including HMD and CAVE variants) within a broader set of Mixed Reality. Note that it also identifies Augmented Virtuality, a form of VR with windows into the real world.

This is not the only such conception!

![world through the computer](https://www.sonycsl.co.jp/person/rekimoto/uist95/style.gif)

In [The World through the Computer: Computer Augmented Interaction with Real World Environments, Jun Rekimoto and Katashi Nagao, UIST 1995](https://www.sonycsl.co.jp/person/rekimoto/uist95/uist95.html), VR is distinguished from earlier systems by surrounding the human with computation in a complete field of interaction, partially sealed off from the outer world. Ubiquitous computing (such as with mobile devices, physical computing etc.) places computing in the real world but only at specific locations, and AR makes computation a window through which the real is experienced.

VR, AR, and mixed reality are respective subsets of Computer-**Mediated Reality**, in which the machine is used to add to, subtract from, or manipulate one's perception of reality. 

![Mediated Reality](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Viraugmixmodmediated_reality.png)

In Neal Stephensen's SnowCrash the **Metaverse** is seen as a convergence of virtually-enhanced physical reality and a physically-persistent virtual space; encompassing virtual worlds, augmented reality, mirror worlds (like google earth), and life-logging; each occupying quadrants of  internal/external, augmented/simulated dimensions.

The use of simulation and perceptually-limited mediation leads naturally to the question of simulated reality: the notion that the world we experience is itself a simulation or simulacrum; as proposed by Moravec in 1998 (though the notion of a computational reality is much older, and there is the obvious antecedent of Plato's Cave), and celebrated in The Matrix.

Are dreams also simulations? In a similar way, philosophers since Zhuangzi (4thC BC), and from Descartes in the West, have noted that the 'dream hypothesis' cannot be ruled out. And both the dream and simulation hypotheses are further complicated by the possibility of nesting: worlds within worlds, simulations within simulations, dreams within dreams (as utilized by Inception).

### A note on the term "Mixed Reality Video"

Since 2015 "Mixed Reality" has also begun to be used to describe overlaying real footage of an immersant wearing a head-mounted display, with footage taken from a virtual camera in the simulated world, at the same location -- with game designers now calling this **mixed reality video**. See for example [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYfNzhLXYGc), and the guidelines for using Unreal to achieve it [here](http://uploadvr.com/epic-unreal-engine-4-mixed-reality-support). It is an unfortunate reduction of the full sense of Mixed Reality.

Especially the part where there's an interaction equivalent of title-safe guides.
A lot of attention being given to what works for the medium here, and awareness of a longer history outside the obvious.

Learn from architects and interior designers (and also theatre/film set designers...). By the way, this was a presentation for [his Masters thesis](http://aperturesciencellc.com/vr/VisualDesignMethodsforVR_MikeAlger.pdf).




Mixamo
https://www.mixamo.com
Animated 3D characters. No 3D knowledge required. Rapidly create, rig and animate unique characters for design projects.
Workflow for Unreal: https://www.mixamo.com/workflows/unreal
But some caveats, in particular be careful to only grab animations with the "In-place" option. Otherwise you have to retarget the root bone [as described here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJNiRPGAqk). See [discussion here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/4m6woy/fuse_and_mixamo/)
