<ul>
<li>&quot;An artificial world that consists of images and sounds created by a computer and affected by the actions of a person who is experiencing it.&quot; - Merriam-Webster</li>
<li>&quot;Computer technologies that use software to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that replicate a real environment (or create an imaginary setting), and simulate a user&#39;s physical presence in this environment, by enabling the user to interact with this space and any objects depicted therein using specialized display screens or projectors and other devices. &quot; - Wikipedia</li>
</ul>
<p>VR has also been defined as inducing targeted behaviour (such as having a designed experience) in an organism by using artificial sensory stimulation, while the organism has little or no awareness of the interference (LaValle 2016). The &#39;no awareness&#39; condition has elsewhere been more eloquently articulated as <strong>&#39;the illusion of non-mediation&#39;</strong>. </p>

<h2 id="what-illusions-">What illusions?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Film/animation depends on a perceptual illusion -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision">persistence of vision</a>. This is easier to understand via animation: around 12-15 frames per second is enough for the brain to interpret as movement, but only when sequent images are plausible enough to be fused. <em>Plausibility</em> in this case is a function of neurophysiology and cognition. (Of course, cinema also depends on other perceptual quirks, such as the brain&#39;s acceptance of cuts in editing even though nothing like a cut exists in real life, the suspension of disbelief through non-human perspectives, and so forth.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stereoscopic 3D (S3D) builds on another perceptual illusion. Presenting to each eye a viewpoint slightly displaced laterally emulates the <em>parallax effect</em> -- one of the most powerful visual cues to impart depth (distance). Again, this is dependent on the human body, and also requires very careful alignment. Some, though few, people experience discomfort due to discrepancies between the stereoscopic 3D depth cue and others that are lacking, such as vergence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Virtual reality depends on both of these illusions, and others such as egocentric spatialized audio, and greatly benefits from wide field of view, high resolution, and other factors of <strong>immersion</strong>. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>The crucial addition for VR is <em>head tracking</em>, which means we can present a coherent image regardless of what direction we face. This illusion breaks down if the delay between movement and image (motion-to-photon) is greater than a couple of handfuls of milliseconds, which underlies the need for high frame rates (90fps for current desktop models) to avoid nauseating &quot;judder&quot;. </p>
</li>
<li><p>This illusion is greatly enhanced by <em>position tracking</em>: matching the lateral movements of the head as well as its orientation, so that you can look around, over and under things, and generally benefit from more kinds of depth cues we experience in real life, as well as further reducing the chance of nausea.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The result is that the viewer no longer perceives an image plane worn in front of the eyes, and instead perceives oneself being present in another world. Instead of an image moving in front of your eyes, the world appears as a fixed space in which you are moving your own head. (This also means that stereoscopic content can be as close as your nose, something that S3D cinema cannot normally achieve because of the limits of the frame).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The combination of all the above can create a compelling immersive experience. Instead of an image moving in front of your eyes, the world appears as a fixed space in which you are moving your own head. Together with the qualities of content, this leads to the evocation of <strong>presence</strong>, the sense of actually being-there in the world; a continuous illusion of non-mediation. </p>
</li>
<li><p>But aside from presence, VR also maximizes interaction (the extent to which a user can manipulate objects and the environment of the system) and autonomy (the system&#39;s ability to receive and react to external stimuli, such as actions performed by a user). In that regard, convincing experiences created by <strong>real-time simulations that support agency</strong> -- the ability to take meaningful action in a world and discover meaningful consequences -- are just as essential.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-vr">A brief history of VR</h2>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Lascaux_painting.jpg" alt="cave"></p>
<p>30,000 BCE-: From the firelit cave paintings of Lascaux to the birth of painting, architecture, and other arts, we have been attempting to recreate both the world around us and our imagination within.</p>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Dschuang-Dsi-Schmetterlingstraum-Zhuangzi-Butterfly-Dream.jpg" alt="butterfly"></p>
<p>4thC BCE: Zhuangzi dreams he is a butterfly, but questions if he is a butterfly dreaming he is a man. Are dreams also simulations? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, a fluttering butterfly. What fun he had, doing as he pleased! He did not know he was Zhou. Suddenly he woke up and found himself to be Zhou. He did not know whether Zhou had dreamed he was a butterfly or a butterfly had dreamed he was Zhou. Between Zhou and the butterfly there must be some distinction. This is what is meant by the transformation of things.
During our dreams we do not know we are dreaming. We may even dream of interpreting a dream. Only on waking do we know it was a dream. Only after the great awakening will we realize that this is the great dream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Platon_Cave_Sanraedam_1604.jpg" alt="cave"></p>
<p>~380 BCE: Plato likens the uneducated to prisoners in a cave unable to turn their heads. A fire behind them casts shadows of puppets, also behind them, such that all they can see are the puppets&#39; shadows on the wall in front. Such prisoners mistake appearance for reality. (The allegory is intended to show that the names we give for things, to allow us as prisoners to converse about what we see, are in fact names for things that we cannot see, but only grasp with the mind. That is, the real meaning of the words we use is not something that we can ever see with our senses alone. But we can only know this by being liberated from the illusion of the shadows.)</p>
<p>1637-1672: René Descartes invents conventions for analytic geometry and algebraic approaches to geometry; for which reason we still describe space in X, Y and Z axes and call this &quot;Cartesian&quot; coordinates. He believed that algebra was a method to automate reasoning. </p>
<p>Descartes also uses methodological skepticism to question his existence and perception, and whether he is dreaming or things are externally real. Influenced by the mechanical automatons of his time, he draws attention to the problem of the connection between body and mind, inadvertently launching a dualism that dominates Western thought thenceforth and remains an influence over and problem of VR. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;VR opens the door to what Jaron Lanier (who coined the term virtual reality in the 1980s) calls “post-symbolic communication”: No longer are we limited to communicating via sequences of symbols represented by audible vibrations of our vocal chords, or produced by our fingers pressing on a series of keys or, more recently, a flat piece of glass. Instead, you experience my dream directly, without having to interpret long strings of verbal or written symbols... The medium, the place where those stories will unfold, exists within our consciousness. We’ll find ourselves having passed through our long-held, precious frames to live within those stories. And we’ll carry the memory of those stories not as content that we once consumed, but as times and spaces we existed within.&quot; - <a href="http://virtualrealitypop.com/futureofvr-8be30f0fca6a#.n1s3d4n92">source</a></p>

<p>1800&#39;s: The popular wave of massive-scale panorama paintings, often with dedicated buildings, usually depicting landscapes and/or historic events. </p>
<p>At the same time, the first attempts to capture permanent images from camera obscura (themselves inspired by caves...) through chemical means marks the birth of photography.</p>
<p>1838: Sir Charles Wheatstone invents <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu6SOckMxT0&amp;feature=youtu.be">stereoscopic photography</a>.</p>
<p>1885/1935: L&#39;Arrivée d&#39;un Train </p>
<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55906895" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The train moving directly towards the camera, shot in 1895, was said to have terrified spectators at the first screening, a claim that has been called an urban legend. What most film histories leave out is that the Lumière Brothers were trying to achieve a 3D image even prior to this first-ever public exhibition of motion pictures, and later re-shot the film in stereoscopic 3D, first screened in 1935. Given the contradictory accounts that plague early cinema and pre-cinema accounts, it&#39;s plausible that early cinema historians conflated the audience reactions of the 2D and 3D screenings of L&#39;Arrivée d&#39;un Train.</p>
<p>1901: L. Frank Baum, an author, first mentions the idea of an electronic display/spectacles that overlays data onto real life (in this case &#39;people&#39;), it is named a &#39;character marker&#39;.</p>
<p>1935: Stanley G. Weinbaum&#39;s short story &quot;Pygmalion&#39;s Spectacles&quot; describes a goggle-based virtual reality system with holographic recording of fictional experiences, including smell and touch: &quot;You are in the story, you speak to the shadows (characters) and they reply, and instead of being on a screen, the story is all about you, and you are in it.&quot;</p>

<p>1965: Ivan Sutherland pens <a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Sutherland%20-%20The%20Ultimate%20Display.pdf">The Ultimate Display. Ivan E Sutherland, 1965</a>, inspiring everything from the Holodeck to the Matrix. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The ultimate display would, of course, be a room within which the computer can control the existence of matter. A chair displayed in such a room would be good enough to sit in. Handcuffs displayed in such a room would be confining, and a bullet displayed in such a room would be fatal. With appropriate programming such a display could literally be the Wonderland into which Alice walked.&quot;</p>

<h2 id="the-message-of-the-medium">The message of the medium</h2>
<p>VR and AR expected to disrupt not only games and film, but also music, advertising, social media, education, travel, and who knows what else (maybe Black Mirror does). But do we know what we are doing?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Palmer Luckey, Oculus CEO: &quot;I think it will be VR content and software that will drive the industry long term&quot;. </p>
<p>Richard Marks, Sony Magic Lab: &quot;Wild West... there are no established genres. You don&#39;t get that opportunity very often.&quot; </p>
<p>Michael Abrash, Chief Scientist, Oculus: &quot;The future of VR lies in the unique experiences that get created in software, and if I knew what those would be, even in broad outline, I would be very happy.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is even obvious in the instability of terminology. Is it a game, a film, an experience, a simulation, a world, ...? Are we audience / viewer / visitor / cybernaut / immersant / player / user ...?</p>

<p>&quot;A new medium can suggest a multitude of approaches. In 1929, Dziga Vertov&#39;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z97Pa0ICpn8">The Man with the Movie Camera</a> catalogued possibilities for the evolution of film. From narrative structures to special effects, it shows <em>what cinema could have become</em>. Virtual reality occupies a similar historical moment--it is unformed and hence its possibilities seem unconstrained.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Although the artistic community has often been excluded from the development of new technologies, this situation is changing. Artists no longer sit on the sidelines eventually to become grateful users of borrowed tools but have become active in development, creating a disturbance in the field with new contingencies... A new medium like Virtual Reality challenges traditional conventions not because the participant wears a helmet or glove but because it suggests new relationships between the viewer and the viewed... Unfortunately, as the medium of virtual environments becomes more and more defined, different approaches will be ignored, abandoned, or forgotten as the medium coalesces into a mature form.&quot; - Douglas MacLeod, Director of the Banff Art and Virtual Environments Project, in the preface of Moser, Mary Anne, and Douglas MacLeod. <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/immersed-technology">Immersed in technology: art and virtual environments. MIT Press, 1996.</a>, emphasis added.</p>

<p>The above citation neatly captures the aims of this course. In 2016, twenty years since this was written, and nearly fifty years since virtual reality&#39;s birth, it is finally becoming a widely-available consumer medium. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...in these early stages of the VR lifespan, a common mishap is occurring: content creators shoehorning old formats into new technologies. As we explore this new medium, we are building on the backs of film, theater, narrative games and visual art to takes cues as to what to create in VR.&quot; <a href="http://vrscout.com/news/virtual-reality-and-360-film/">Will Virtual Reality and 360° Film Experience an Industry Divide?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of shoehorning, what can earlier developments of cinema, game, performance and visual (and sonic) arts tell us about the the explosion of virtual reality (VR) in our imminent future? Theories, methods, and unique modes of expression have yet to be established by the collision of gaming technology with cinema. As with any emerging medium, a willingness to break rules, abandon habits and re-learn is necessary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hayao Miyazaki is <a href="https://youtu.be/jtTBYMvLBbw">quoted</a> as making the following observation: &quot;[anime] is produced by humans who can&#39;t stand looking at other humans.” I am proposing that this observation is not limited to anime. Much of what our culture makes seems to be made against, rather than for, other humans. Cities made for cars and rent extraction are simply a very large, indeed inescapable symptom of the and disease. We could say the same for industrialized art and music and nearly every globalized thing we come into contact with. The issue ... is the difference between the imagined, idealized vision, and its eventual commodification. For a brief moment, each new technology opens a space of freedom and opportunity. It is easy to mistake this space for something permanent. In reality, it is just the wave receding before the next tsunami. Whatever freedom can exist will have to be found on a different shore. For the creative person, this is adventure and excitement and possibility. But for everyone else, the tsunami can be devastating.&quot; - Marcos Novak</p>
