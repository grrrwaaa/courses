This hands-on course gives you an opportunity to learn about new screen technologies, approaches and techniques in a lab environment, and participate in the evolution of emerging media. In 2015-2016, the course will give you the opportunity to engage with wearable immersive virtual reality [(VR)](vr.html) technology via the Oculus Rift headset on both practical and theoretical levels to understand, create and imagine new kinds of worlds. 

You will work in the lab to build prototypes that will function as a testing ground. You are encouraged to be both theorists and practical experimenters, to research while doing, understanding that the process of exploring firsthand is an important step toward the kinds of knowledge and ways of knowing enabled and encouraged by these evocative new digital technologies, and suggest new ways to think about future forms of the moving image, from new literacies to new audiences. The course will expose you to the imperfect software support for building worlds, and encourage you to think about and beyond their limits. Our work is put into context and guided by a century of preceding theory and practice even as we try, collectively, to imagine moving images and screens of the future, through discussions interwoven with the individual and group projects.

Students with backgrounds in film, digital media, design, theatre, music, architecture, video production, and visual storytelling are welcome, as are students with programming, human-computer interaction, or computer graphics backgrounds. Knowledge of Max/MSP/Jitter, Unity/Unreal, Cinder/OpenFrameworks, or related software will be at an advantage, but is not required. The labs aim to accelerate development such that the technology need not be so difficult to penetrate. Above all, creative thinking with and through technology is the most important asset that you can bring to this course. This seminar and its associated lab component are understood to be very much an experimental think tank whose success very much depends on your collective enthusiasm and active engagement.
