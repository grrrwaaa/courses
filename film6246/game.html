<p>The most recent wave of VR history comes initially from the world of gaming. Looking at <a href="http://share.oculus.com">share.oculus.com</a> it is clear that the current main thrust of content is still games. Nevertheless, the games that <em>work</em> in VR are not necessarily the same as those that work on the console, PC, tablet etc. And within the collection there are some remarkable <em>experiences</em> that stretch the typical expectations of video games. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/pdp-1/spacewar/"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Spacewar!-PDP-1-20070512.jpg" alt="spacewar"></a></p>
<h2 id="a-brief-overview">A brief overview</h2>
<p>The computer/video games industry (AKA interactive entertainment industry) is 43 years old. </p>
<ul>
<li>50&#39;s/60&#39;s: academic/research experiments (e.g. <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/pdp-1/spacewar/">SpaceWar</a>!)</li>
<li>70&#39;s: arcade and console games. Many corporates begin as small or single developer teams. </li>
<li>80&#39;s: comparable scale (culture/market, budgets/profits) to movies (and pop). rise of PC games, “bedroom coder”</li>
<li>90&#39;s: 3D hardware, massive memory -&gt; “cinematic” productions, huge teams, online games</li>
<li>00&#39;s: dominance of corporates and major license serials begins to be subverted by casual (mobile/web) and indie games</li>
<li>By 2011 global market estimated at US$65 billion. The video game industry made twice as much money in 2013 than did the film industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, in the last decade, employee disillusionment with treatment at corporates, creative limitation by publishers, has created a return to a (possibly spurious) &quot;golden age&quot; of smaller and more independent development teams, attracted to freedom of expression/experimentation and authorship/ownership. Many indie games are known for innovation, creativity, and artistic experimentation, and some have become very successful (e.g. Minecraft). </p>
<p>The core question of this course is naturally more closely aligned to these characteristics, as it is also the question of the medium itself. In that vein...</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-is-a-game-">What exactly is a game?</h2>
<p><img src="http://theviralmedialab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/realitybroken.jpg" alt="reality is broken"></p>
<p>Pr&eacute;cis, Chapter 1, <a href="http://janemcgonigal.com/my-book/">Reality is Broken. Jane McGonigal. 2001</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;game&quot; and &quot;player&quot; are currently culturally pejorative terms<ul>
<li>reflect fear of losing track of where game ends and reality begins</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>incredible diversity of what games can be, within &amp; beyond digital media</li>
<li>despite diversity, there are four defining traits of games:<ul>
<li><strong>goal(s)</strong>: outcomes to achieve, focusing attention and orienting partipation. <em>Purpose</em>. </li>
<li><strong>rules</strong>: limitations on how goals can be achieved. &quot;Rules push players to explore previously uncharted possibility spaces. They unleash creativity and foster strategic thinking.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>feedback system</strong>: Tells players how close they are to achieving goals. Points, levels, scores, progress bars, &quot;the game is over when...&quot;, etc. A <em>promise</em> of achievability, and a <em>motivation</em> to continue playing.</li>
<li><strong>voluntary participation</strong>: All players knowingly and willingly accept the goal, rules, and feedback. A common ground for participation. Freedom to enter/leave establishes a <em>safe</em> and <em>pleasurable</em> activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>everything else, things that could be common features, are there to enhance these four traits<ul>
<li><em>immersive graphics increase our ability to pay sustained attention</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bernard Suits sums it up: <strong>&quot;Playing a game is the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.&quot;</strong><ul>
<li>JM later paraphrases: <em>&quot;any well-designed game is an invitation to tackle an unnecessary obstacle&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>JM works through traits in a diversity of examples: <ul>
<li>golf: choosing to make the work of getting a ball into a hall more difficult.</li>
<li>Scrabble: &quot;freedom to work in the most logical and efficient way is the very <em>opposite</em> of gameplay&quot;</li>
<li>Tetris: <ul>
<li>Variety and intensity of feedback is what differentiates digital and non-digital games. You can feel how attentive the game is. Brings you to very limits of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology">flow</a>). </li>
<li>Most addictive game, but you can&#39;t ever win. Competition and winning are <em>not</em> defining features of games. Related to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games">infinite games</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Portal: The goal in the first scene is to find out what the goal is. Common strategy today (gamers don&#39;t read manuals). In each puzzle you have to teach yourself the physics (the rules). Four traits are there, but in a different order. We are given feedback first, rather than goal + rules. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DmUA9N99X8">Somebody playing Portal 2 on the Oculus Rift</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a goal is compelling, the feedback is motivating, players will wrestle with the limitations creatively, sincerely, seriously, and enthusiastically for a long time (until exhausted). This is being <em>&quot;gameful&quot;</em>. </li>
<li>Why do unnecessary obstacles make us happy? [JM is building an argument for <em>gamification</em>]<ul>
<li>Hard work that we choose to do.<ul>
<li>Diversity of hard work games offer: <strong>high-stakes work, busywork, mental work, physical work, discovery work, teamwork, creative work</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The opposite of play isn&#39;t work. It&#39;s depression: pessimistic sense of inadequacy, despondent lack of activity. <ul>
<li>reversed: optimistic sense of capabilities, invigorating rush of activity. Sounds like gameplay.</li>
<li>playing activates all neurological/physiological systems of  happiness: attention systems, reward center, motivation systems, emotion &amp; memory centers </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We resent hard work we don&#39;t choose to do. It stresses us, or bores us, etc. [It doesn&#39;t match us.]     </li>
<li>Psychologists found that relaxing fun (tv, chocolate, window-shopping etc.) doesn&#39;t make us feel better; mildly depressing. <em>We seek passive/low-engagement experiences to counterbalance overstimulation/overwhelmedness</em> but we overdo it. <ul>
<li>better to seek &quot;hard fun&quot;, <em>&quot;eustress&quot;</em>, in which there is no real danger or failure</li>
<li>Tal Ben-Shahar: <strong>&quot;we&#39;re much happier <em>enlivening</em> time rather than killing time.&quot;</strong></li>
<li><em>Fiero</em>: possibly the most primal emotional rush we can experience. Italian for pride, adopted by game designers. Triumph over adversity. One of the most powerful neurochemical highs we can experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;A good game is a unique way of structuring experience and provoking positive emotion.&quot;</em> [Even horror games]<ul>
<li>JM gamification moral: motivate hard work, inspire participation, of millions, by giving well-designed games to play instead of systems for people to &quot;game&quot;, to make a better world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Gamification: The use of game thinking and game mechanics to engage users in solving problems. I.e. making your day job/school life like a game, manipulating your natural desires for competition, achievement, status, self-expression, altruism, and closure. It has been used for crowdsourcing (foldit, google ESP), marketing, and training. &quot;Exploitationware&quot; (Ian Bogost). The reward is external to the gameplay (Jane McGonigal); prefer intrinsic reward of “gameful design”. Reward systems can stifle creativity, and encourage hurried rather than deep activity.</p>

<h2 id="manifesto-for-a-ludic-century-erik-zimmerman-">Manifesto for a ludic century (Erik Zimmerman)</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--9tFMzc-3--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18zn2cbev4oycjpg.jpg" alt="Mario Runner"></p>
<p>Erik Zimmerman&#39;s article <a href="http://kotaku.com/manifesto-the-21st-century-will-be-defined-by-games-1275355204">on Kotaku</a>, formed as a manifesto, argues for games as the defining medium of the current century:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The last century&#39;s media was based on information communication: linear, often unidirectional; creating bureaucratic systems. This century&#39;s media is non-linear, systemic, modular, participatory, customizable, playful. Environmental: immersive, inhabitable, explorable. Complex systems thinking. </p>
<p>It is not enough to merely be a systems-literate person; to understand systems in an analytic sense. We also must learn to be playful in them. A playful system is a human system, a social system rife with contradictions and with possibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ian Bogost&#39;s response: <a href="https://medium.com/matter/winning-isnt-everything-255b3a26d1cf">Winning Isn&#39;t Everything</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> &quot;I used to think that games would be the dominant medium of the 21st century. The reality? They&#39;re too big, too complex, and too smart for that to be true.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-is-a-notgame-nongame-ungame-anti-game-">What is a notgame|nongame|ungame|anti-game?</h2>
<p><a href="http://notgames.org">notgames.org</a> - &quot;Can we create a form of digital entertainment that explicitly rejects the structure of games? ... that does not rely on competition, goals, rewards, winning or losing?&quot;</p>
<p>The most interesting innovators and movements in art are born from rejecting tradition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;a form of entertainment that really doesn&#39;t have a winner, or even a real conclusion&quot; - Nintendo president Satoru Iwata (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-game">wikipedia</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Non-games have existed since the early days of video games, although there hasn&#39;t been a specific term for them. The most famous large-scale industry examples are SimCity and Second Life, but recently there has been a lot more active creativity outside the normal bounds of gaming, especially coming from the indie community, and more widely considered close to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_games_as_an_art_form">games-as-art</a>. In the last couple of years, some have been called &quot;walking simulators&quot; (whether this is derogative or cute?) -- although this doesn&#39;t capture the full range of experiences found, the rejection of common tropes and trend toward purposelessness is evident. </p>
<p>Inevitably, here&#39;s another manifesto: <a href="http://notgames.org/blog/2010/03/19/not-a-manifesto/">Michael Samyn. Not a Manifesto</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;One obvious difference between art and games is that you can win a game. It has rules, points, objectives, and an outcome. Santiago might cite an immersive game without points or rules, but I would say then it ceases to be a game and becomes a representation of a story, a novel, a play, dance, a film. Those are things you cannot win; you can only experience them.&quot; <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/video-games-can-never-be-art">Roger Ebert, &quot;Video games can never be art&quot;</a>. <em>(Ebert later conceded that games may indeed be art in a non-traditional sense.)</em></p>
<p>Now that there&#39;s so much willingness, technology and skill to create beautiful virtual worlds, it&#39;s disappointing how many videogames cling to obstacle-based designs. As if players have to earn the privilege to explore by passing an irrelevant test. Now is the time to open up this medium, to let go of our affections and addictions, of our loyalty to childhood memories, to open up the beauty of videogames for the world to see... Let design mean the building of bridges and the opening of doors, not the hiding of keys and the cowardly sniper shot. (Michael Samyn, TaleOfTales)</p>

<h3 id="proteus">Proteus</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.visitproteus.com">Proteus</a> is an &quot;open world exploration game&quot;. <strong>It has no specific goals.</strong> Every creature and plant has a unique musical signature. The game world is procedurally generated, creating a unique layout each game. Non-realistic 8-bit style. Slow-paced.</p>
<p>Proteus sold 23,000 copies in first nine months. It achieved 80% rating on metacritic (despite “not being a game”...)</p>

<h3 id="journey">Journey</h3>
<p>Journey is an indie video game. In Journey, the player controls a robed figure in a vast desert, traveling towards a mountain in the distance. Other players on the same journey can be discovered, and two players can meet and assist each other, but they cannot communicate via speech or text and cannot see each other&#39;s names. The robed figure wears a trailing scarf, which when charged by approaching floating pieces of cloth, briefly allows the player to float through the air. The developers sought to evoke in the player a sense of smallness and wonder, and to forge an emotional connection between them and the anonymous players they meet along the way. - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_(2012_video_game">wiki</a>)</p>

<h3 id="flower">Flower</h3>
<p>In Flower, the player controls the wind, blowing a flower petal through the air using the movement of the game controller. Flying close to flowers results in the player&#39;s petal being followed by other flower petals. Flower was primarily intended to arouse positive emotions in the player, rather than to be a challenging and &quot;fun&quot; game. The team viewed their efforts as creating a work of art, removing gameplay elements and mechanics that were not provoking the desired response in the players. </p>

<p>The game primarily comprises a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the player&#39;s character and simple objects using &quot;the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device&quot;, a device that can create inter-spatial portals between two flat planes. Portal was acclaimed as one of the most original games of 2007.</p>

<p>Dear Esther is an experimental first-person art video game developed by The Chinese Room. The game does not follow traditional video game conventions, as it involves minimal interaction from the player and does not require choices to be made nor tasks to be completed. It instead places focus on its story, which is told through a fragmented, epistolary narrative as the player explores an unnamed island in the Hebrides.</p>

The caves are a unique break in Dear Esther&#39;s bleak, open environments that allowed room to explore a more surreal, organic style that was full of metaphors and hidden imagery... One of my pet gripes is that every game today wants to look like it&#39;s shot through Michael Bay&#39;s sunglasses or JJ Abrams&#39; asshole&quot;</p>
<p>By October 2013 Dear Esther sold over 750,000 copies.</p>
