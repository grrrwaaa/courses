## Experience Design

We can draw inspiration from [The Art of Game Design](http://www.amazon.ca/The-Art-Game-Design-Edition/dp/1466598646) ([seen here](http://www.sfu.ca/~lws2/summercamp/Art_Game_Design.pdf)). Although this book *is* oriented toward games in particular, the approach it takes is broad enough that most elements can be applied to experiences whether game-like or notgame-like. Written by one of the world's top game designers, it addresses game design holistically through a set of questions drawn in concurrent perspectives, or *"lenses"*, gradually building up a map that looks like this:
