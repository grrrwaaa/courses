> Let no one say otherwise, shooting 360 video is difficult and intense! It’s a medium that has completely unique challenges. And that is exciting for both the tech folk and the storytellers. But you’ll need to understand the many hurdles so that you can soar. Knowing the specific details, inherent limitations, and potential problems will only help to inform how to successfully create immersion. And that is what this book aims to do! We know technology will evolve exponentially, softwares will update, hardware will become smaller, lighter, and more efficient. The chapters we have written thus far could be irrelevant as of yesterday. so please continually constantly self-develop with us.

## Game

McGonigal, Jane. Reality is broken: Why games make us better and how they can change the world. Penguin, 2011. *[Chapter 1 seen here](http://hci.stanford.edu/courses/cs047n/readings/Reality_is_Broken.pdf)*

> More than 174 million Americans are gamers, and the average young person in the United States will spend ten thousand hours gaming by the age of twenty-one. According to world-renowned game designer Jane McGonigal, the reason for this mass exodus to virtual worlds is that videogames are increasingly fulfilling genuine human needs. In this groundbreaking exploration of the power and future of gaming, McGonigal reveals how we can use the lessons of game design to fix what is wrong with the real world.

Carse, James. Finite and infinite games. Simon and Schuster, 2011. *[Chapter 1 Seen here](http://wtf.tw/ref/carse.pdf)*

> With this philosophy text, Carse demonstrates a way of looking at actions in life as being a part of at least two types of what he describes as "games", finite and infinite. Both games are played within rules, as agreed upon by the participants; however, the meaning of the rules is different for the two types of games. The book stresses a non-serious (or "playful") view of life on the part of "players", referring to their choices as "moves", and societal constructs and mores as "rules" and "boundaries". He regularly employs familiar terms in specialized ways, but casts them as associated with finite or infinite play & players. Boundaries are "rules" that one must stay within when playing a finite game, in contrast with horizons, which move with the player, and are constantly changing as he or she "plays". In short, a finite game is played with the purpose of winning (thus ending the game), while an infinite game is played with the purpose of continuing the play.

> Previous centuries have been defined by novels and cinema. In a bold manifesto we're proud to debut here on Kotaku, game designer Eric Zimmerman states that this century will be defined by games.

[Ebert, Roger. "Video games can never be art." Roger Ebert’s Journal (2010).](http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/video-games-can-never-be-art)

> Having once made the statement above, I have declined all opportunities to enlarge upon it or defend it. That seemed to be a fool's errand, especially given the volume of messages I receive urging me to play this game or that and recant the error of my ways. Nevertheless, I remain convinced that in principle, video games cannot be art. Perhaps it is foolish of me to say "never," because never, as Rick Wakeman informs us, is a long, long time. Let me just say that no video gamer now living will survive long enough to experience the medium as an art form.

[Samyn, Michael. "Not a manifesto." Notgames blog (2010).](http://notgames.org/blog/2010/03/19/not-a-manifesto/)

> Can we create a form of digital entertainment that explicitly rejects the structure of games? What is an interactive work of art that does not rely on competition, goals, rewards, winning or losing?
