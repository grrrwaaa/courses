<h2 id="course-description">Course description</h2>
<p>In this year-long studio course, the entire class collaborates on the realization of one or two ambitious projects. Students will work together as a development team by taking on roles where they focus on specific aspects of the project (such as Director, Designer, Artist, Programmer, Sound Engineer, Interaction Designer, Publicity). The development team structure is modeled on teams used in large-scale project development within fields related to Digital Media, such as contemporary art practice, game development, creative software development, and interactive experience development that rely on multi-stakeholder collaboration and interdisciplinary research.</p>
<p>Projects may incorporate partnerships with York-based Faculties, Departments, or research teams depending on the focus of the project. The nature of the project will vary from year to year, but will be a significant work in the field of Digital Media. The details of the project(s) will be developed as part of the class activities. As part of the project development and execution students will be expected to prepare presentations, posters, and a written paper. The culmination of this course will be a final presentation, which will be open to the public. In addition to group assignments, students are evaluated based on their individual contribution, teamwork, presentations, and other deliverables as appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Organization of the Course:</strong> This is course is comprised of two parts. In the fall semester, students will work in teams with assigned roles developing a proposal and prototype for an interactive installation. Faculty, invited guests and students will review the proposals, and one or two proposals will be selected for full development by whole class, and public installation at the end of the winter semester. Class time will be devoted to lectures, technical workshops, visiting speakers, and group meetings. Students can expect to spend up to three hours per week on assignments and contributions to group work outside of class time.</p>

<p><strong>Grading</strong>: The grading scheme for the course conforms to the 9-point grading system used in undergraduate programs at York (e.g., A+ = 9, A = 8, B+ - 7, C+ = 5, etc.). Assignments and tests will bear either a letter grade designation or a corresponding number grade (e.g., A+ = 90 to 100, A = 80 to 90, B+ = 75 to 79, etc.)  For a full description of York grading system see the York University Undergraduate Calendar at <a href="http://calendars.registrar.yorku.ca/2010-2011/academic/index.htm">http://calendars.registrar.yorku.ca/2010-2011/academic/index.htm</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment Submission:</strong> Proper academic performance depends on students doing their work not only well, but on time. Accordingly, assignments for this course must be received on the due date specified for the assignment. <strong><em>All assignments must be submitted to complete the course.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Lateness Penalty:</strong> Assignments received later than the due date will be penalized five grade points per day that assignment is late. Exceptions to the lateness penalty for valid reasons such as illness, compassionate grounds, etc., may be entertained by the Course Instructor but will require supporting documentation (e.g., a doctorâ€™s letter).</p>
