<h2 id="canada-150">Canada 150</h2>
<p>Canada is celebrating the 150th anniversary of Confederation in 2017, and Universities across the country are invited to hold events marking the celebration of our Sesquicentennial. </p>
<p>The goal of the Canada 150 Fund is to create opportunities for Canadians to participate in local, regional, and national celebrations that contribute to building a sense of pride and attachment to Canada.</p>
<p>York University established a Canada 150 fund to support our community marking this tremendous milestone through conferences, talks and new initiatives that explore Canada’s past, and creatively imagine the next 150 years. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Projects may include a range of events and initiatives (conferences, workshops, art installations, other cultural events, etc.), including “virtual” events (videos, podcasts, etc.) Wherever possible and relevant, events should be open to the York community and the public.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Projects should advance York’s strengths and priorities and contribute to building York’s profile and reputation in the broader community. They should also address one or more of the 4 themes selected by the government for Canada 150: The Environment, Diversity and Inclusion, Indigenous, and Youth.</p>
</li>
<li><p>They may be entirely new initiatives designed specifically for Canada 150, or annual events presented with a particular Canada 150 lens or augmented to reflect Canada 150 themes. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Priority will be given to projects involving collaboration and partnerships, including cross-Faculty interdisciplinary collaborations, projects involving other universities, and projects with external partners. Priority will also be given to projects for which some funding is already in place from other sources (i.e. from a Faculty or external body), or is being sought.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is anticipated that funding requests ranging up to approximately $30,000 will be considered, depending on the nature and scope of the project (i.e. $5,000-10,000 for a panel discussion or workshop, $10,000-30,000 for a conference or symposium; larger requests will be considered on an exceptional basis).</p>
<p><strong>Applications submitted by October 1, 2016 will be considered in a first round.</strong></p>
