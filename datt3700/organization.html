	<p>Creative media companies and production teams often subdivide into organizational structures of sections or teams, such as art, design, programming, publicity, operations/management, etc. Many organizations and teams are &#39;activity oriented&#39;, in which personnel are dedicated to only one activity, such as user-experience design, development, testing; working in a single specialized role over many projects. But because of the interdisciplinary nature of our program, and the limited lifetime of the course, ours will be an &#39;outcome oriented&#39; organization, with all roles leading toward the final installation. </p>
<p>As a group: Identify the necessary components of the work, without which it would fail. What kinds of long-term roles are needed to achieve these outcomes? These roles may be individual, or may be teams, according to the estimated scale of the need.</p>
<p>The actual division and assignment into teams may depend on the skill-sets and interests of individuals. Each of you are likely take on more than one role, especially if roles are tied to specific stages of the production. For example, designers can also be testers, planners can also serve on the installation team, etc. But also some may prefer the depth of task specialization, others may prefer to operate in multiple areas. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, clarity is essential: it is much easier to work effectively when you know what you are responsible for, and who you need to coordinate with. Thus you will need to identify a project manager, as they have the first task in documenting the outcomes, roles, and organizational structure of teams. </p>
<p>Some possible teams or structures might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operations / Project management / Administration</li>
</ul>
<p>A Project Manager / Production Director sets deadlines, facilitates communication (e.g. set up regular meetings and mechanisms for &#39;stand up reports&#39;), puts out fires, and is in charge of keeping documents (such as task lists and priority lists) organized and up to date. Essentially, the PM is there to ensure the matching of people and time to the needs of the project. </p>
<p>Task management and structures of regular communication are vital! There must be at least one project manager for the whole process. There may be need for an additional production planner in the first weeks of pre-production, and production manager in the final weeks leading up to the installation. During the development phase between these, each development team may need a lead to report to the project manager.</p>
<p>Likely there&#39;s also a role of administration, which becomes more important as finances become involved and proper accountability is needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vision / Design</li>
</ul>
<p>In early pre-production stages, the design / vision team&#39;s role is to create the blueprint of the idea, with a focus on user experience (UX), by a combination of brainstorming, pitching to other project members, and tasking research to all members. Research may involve, for example, technical investigations/proof of concept, historical/geographical research, related art research, and so on, used to validate and refine the design. The main outcome of this process is the production of a <em>Design Document</em> or <em>Specification</em>. </p>
<p>As the design solidifies, designers may naturally migrate to other production teams. And as the project progresses, designers also take part in testing &amp; quality assurance (QA), matching the outcomes to the design.</p>
<ul>
<li>Art</li>
</ul>
<p>Though sometimes part of the design team, it is often helpful to distinguish the art production (even if it may be many of the same people). This means taking the original concept sketches and design specifications to the final results. It could involve creation of material assets, sculptural components, sound design, music. It could also include data capture and mapping to models, user interface design, data visualization, and interaction design. </p>
<p>A common need is to maintain an Art Director, whose primary responsibility is to ensure the vision is preserved and coherent through all features, and to coordinate between the artists and other members of the project. Could be the same person as the Design Lead, but doesn&#39;t need to be.</p>
<ul>
<li>Technology</li>
</ul>
<p>In early stages, coding should be focused on experimentation (discovery of techniques), proof of concept (ensuring feasibility of technical solutions), and production of the technical design spec. The main outcome here is to introduce ideas and answer questions. </p>
<p>This is followed by many many stages of iteration to achieve specific milestones. A common adage here is to &quot;first make it work, then make it right, then make it fast&quot;. It is highly recommended to use a collaborative work space such as Github or Bitbucket. This makes it easier for multiple programmers to work on the same project, with support for isolated features and merging, as well as documented bug and issue tracking that is usable by other group members. </p>
<p>Your project may involve the creation of more than one piece of software, perhaps for multiple platforms. (E.g. don&#39;t forget that web presence may also involve software development.) In this case there may be natural teams along these lines, but somebody needs to be able to coordinate between the parts effectively. </p>
<ul>
<li>Art &amp; Technology?</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly within digital media projects, art &amp; technology development can significantly overlap, so it may make more sense to subdivide by project component than by art &amp; technology. Or, at least, there may be an Art &amp; Technology Lead to coordinate teams.</p>
<ul>
<li>Installation Production</li>
</ul>
<p>It may make sense to strike a dedicated team focused on the installation production, concerned with the physical layout, construction, and experience of the work. Perhaps also a location specialist. This team would come into play later in the project.</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing/Publicity/Business Development</li>
</ul>
<p>This involves designing the media promoting the installation and event, in print and online, and carrying this publicity out. It also involves coming up with the promotion strategy, and writing documentation such as the project and artists&#39; statement. </p>
<ul>
<li>Testing / QA</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned above, this role comes into play toward the end of the project, and follows the design spec again to match against the intended outcomes. Testing means feeding issues and progress to the development roles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Publisher</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#39;s us (Joel &amp; Graham)!</p>
